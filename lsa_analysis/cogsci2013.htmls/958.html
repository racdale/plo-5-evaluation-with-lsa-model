	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>According to Lynch (1960; p. 83) &#8220;the sequence [of
      landmarks] facilitates recognition and memorization&#8221;. Thus, under which
      circumstances do landmarks facilitate wayfinding? We therefore investigated the
      helpfulness of landmarks during route knowledge and survey knowledge retrieval
      from long-term memory. A field study with citizens of a street festival in a
      mid-size German town (Giessen) was performed. Sixty-three participants had to
      draw the shortest possible route between two given locations in the town. Within
      this experiment, two different conditions were tested respectively: drawing the
      route without landmarks and with additionally presented landmarks. A comparison
      of conditions revealed different performance groups: perfect performance (8%);
      performance improvement with additional landmarks (32%); equal performance in
      both conditions (36%); and performance decrement with additional landmarks (23%).
      These results were confirmed in two further experiments. We demonstrate that the
      decremental findings may be a result of the so-called visual impedance effect
      (Knauff & Johnson-Laird, 2002).</p>
