	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Arguments, claims, and discussions about the &#8220;level of
      description&#8221; of a theory are ubiquitous in cognitive science. Such talk is
      typically expressed more precisely in terms of the granularity of the theory, or
      in terms of Marr&#8217;s (1982) three levels (computational, algorithmic, and
      implementation). I argue that these ways of understanding levels of description
      are insufficient to capture the range of different types of theoretical
      commitments that one can have in cognitive science. When we understand these
      commitments as points in a multi-dimensional space, we find that we must also
      reconsider our understanding of intertheoretic relations. In particular, we
      should understand cognitive theories as constraining one another, rather than
      reducing to one another.</p>
