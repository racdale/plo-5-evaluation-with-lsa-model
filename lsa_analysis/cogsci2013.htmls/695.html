	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In a range of contexts, pairs of interacting individuals arrive at
      collective decisions by comparing their confidence in their judgements. This
      tendency to evaluate the reliability of information by the confidence with which
      it is expressed has been termed the &#8216;confidence heuristic&#8217;. In this
      study, we tested two fast and frugal ways of implementing the confidence
      heuristic in the absence of interaction: either directly, by opting for the
      judgement made with higher confidence, or indirectly, by opting for the faster
      judgement, the latter exploiting a widely known inverse correlation between
      confidence and reaction time. We found that the success of these heuristics
      depends on how similar individuals are in terms of their abilities and, more
      importantly, that for dissimilar individuals such heuristics are dramatically
      inferior to interaction. Interaction allows individuals to alleviate &#8211; but
      not fully resolve &#8211; their differences in ability.</p>
