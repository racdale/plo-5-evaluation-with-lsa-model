	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The relationship between reasoning and language has been
      frequently studied. Here we explore principles of spatial reasoning in Germans
      and Russians. We compared the performance of Russians in three different settings
      to the performance of Germans. The task was to construct layouts of wooden blocks
      according to verbal instructions, describing the relations of these blocks.
      Subsequently pieces of new information, introduced as incontrovertible facts and
      partly contradicting the initial descriptions, were given. Participants
      re-arranged the blocks to take into account the new facts. Recent research
      conducted with Germans has shown that &#8211; although alternatives are logical
      equivalent - there are preferences for certain solutions. The question was
      whether Russians show the same or different preferences. Our results suggest that
      construction and revision of spatial models follow similar principles. However,
      we observed differences between the groups regarding the flexibility to apply a
      principle based on the order of words in a sentence.</p>
