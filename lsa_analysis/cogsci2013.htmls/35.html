	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The hypothesis that human cognition may be well characterized as a
      set of Bayesian computations has been the topic of considerable debate over the
      last two decades. Recently, critics have argued that this hypothesis is either
      unlikely to be true or otherwise too unconstrained to be particularly useful for
      explaining cognition (e.g., Bowers & Davis, 2012), whereas proponents have
      defended their position by stating that the Bayesian perspective has been
      misunderstood, is not necessarily in conflict with other perspectives on
      cognition, and can still be explanatorily useful as a framework for cognitive
      science even if under-constrained in many ways (e.g., Griffiths, Chater, Norris,
      & Pouget, 2012). Our position in this debate is that both sides of this debate
      may be right as well as wrong.</p>
