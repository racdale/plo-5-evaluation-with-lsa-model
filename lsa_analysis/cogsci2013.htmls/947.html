	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A classic paradigm for investigating memory is the category recall
      task, where participants recall as many items as possible from a given category,
      within some time window. Category recall tasks have been used to investigate
      memory as a search process, where memory is conceptualized as a landscape with
      distributed resources (resources being the target items of memory recall). Rhodes
      and Turvey (2007) show that the dynamics of memory search are akin to animal
      foraging behavior. Specifically, patterns of recall exhibited L&#233;vy
      processes, which have been observed in many species and at many scales, and are
      hypothesized to be optimal under certain conditions. Here, we investigate the
      effects of social context on L&#233;vy processes using a collaborative category
      recall task. Although the processes of collaborative recall may differ from
      individual recall, our results suggest that the products of that recall are
      similar.</p>
