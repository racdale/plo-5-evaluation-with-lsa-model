	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Verbal overshadowing refers to a phenomenon whereby verbalization
      of a non-verbal stimulus (e.g., he had slant eyes) impairs subsequent non-verbal
      recognition accuracy. In order to understand the mechanism by which this
      phenomenon occurs, we constructed a computational model that was trained to
      generate an individual-face-specific representation upon input of a
      noise-filtered retinotopic face (i.e., face recognition). When the model
      verbalized the facial features before receiving the retinotopic input, the model
      incorrectly recognized a new face input as one of the different, yet
      visually-similar, trained items (that is, a false-alarm occurred). In contrast,
      this recognition error did not occur without prior verbalization. Close
      inspection of the model revealed that verbalization changed the internal
      representation such that it lacked the fine-grained information necessary to
      discriminate visually-similar faces. This supports the view that verbalization
      causes unavailability/degradation of fine-grained non-verbal representations,
      thus impairing recognition accuracy.</p>
