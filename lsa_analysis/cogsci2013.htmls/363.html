	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In two experiments we explored whether participants would be able
      to use probabilistic cues to simplify perceptually demanding visual search in a
      task we call the retrieval guidance paradigm. On each trial a background cue
      appeared prior to (and during) the search task and the diagnosticity of the
      background cue(s) was manipulated to provide complete, partial, or non-diagnostic
      information regarding the target&#8217;s color on each trial. Only when
      participants were made aware of the possible relationship between the background
      cues and target features were they able to utilize the cue information for
      search. When participants were not made aware of the possible connection, they
      were only able to use target base rates. In the General Discussion we address how
      a recent computational model of hypothesis generation (HyGene, Thomas, et al.,
      2008), provides a useful framework for understanding how long-term memory,
      working memory, and attention coordinate in visual search.</p>
