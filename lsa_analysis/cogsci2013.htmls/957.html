	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Crisis management (CM) situations are most-often complex and
      dynamic, and require team members to make optimal decisions under constraints of
      high risk, uncertainty, high workload, and time pressure (see, e.g., Brehmer,
      2007). An Edge Organization (EO) is an adaptive, rapidly reconfigurable, and
      distributed team structure in which no roles are previously assigned, and
      resources are not distributed in advance. Such a team structure is assumed to be
      able to improvise and respond quickly to emerging problems. We used the C3Fire CM
      simulation to measure the coordination (of units and resources) efficiency
      amongst edge team members. Twenty-four teams of four participants completed four
      C3Fire scenarios, each lasting 10 minutes. Results revealed that team members
      achieved better coordination as they progressed through the scenarios. This
      learning effect suggests that it could be beneficial to train team members to
      coordinate their actions efficiently and fully exploit the potential agility
      provided by EO.</p>
