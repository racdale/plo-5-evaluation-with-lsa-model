	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In Chinese, character configuration and orthographic combination
      are acknowledged to influence character recognition. Also, it was widely accepted
      that lexical access ability progresses as reading skills improved and vocabulary
      increased. The present study aims to reveal the effects of configuration type and
      radical properties by comparing different development stages of Chinese learning.
      A character decision task was used in which radical position-based frequency and
      radical position regularities within two different configurations were
      manipulated. 15 third-grade 27 sixth-grade schoolers, and 41 undergraduate
      students were asked to identify whether the 120 pseudo-words conform to radical
      position regularities. Accuracy was recorded as measurement to examine the
      effects of configuration and orthographic combination. The analysis revealed
      different patterns of frequency effect and regularity effect between the two
      configurations. Furthermore, age variation was observed for both types of
      configurations. In conclusion, orthographic and configuration knowledge are
      acquired gradually and play distinct roles in Chinese recognition.</p>
