	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Creating correct shape categories requires young children to
      overcome reliance on perceptual features and surface similarity as cues for
      membership and to use abstract rules as bases for categorization (e.g., triangles
      are enclosed shapes with three sides). Relying on surface similarity, children
      often wrongly include non-triangles that resemble familiar triangles in the
      triangle category, and exclude unfamiliar actual triangles. This study attempted
      to improve preschool-age children&#8217;s triangle categorizations by presenting
      structurally aligned comparisons that either shared a common structure or that
      highlighted a contrasting structure. Across both types of comparisons, the
      exemplars were either highly or lowly superficially similar (both variables
      manipulated between subjects). We hypothesized that low-similarity
      common-structure comparisons would support extension of the triangle category
      beyond prototypical exemplars, while high-similarity contrastive alignments would
      highlight category boundaries. Preliminary results suggested that improvement in
      categorization accuracy was primarily driven by a reduction in erroneous
      identification of a non-triangle as a triangle.</p>
