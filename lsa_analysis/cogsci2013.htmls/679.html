	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Two category-learning experiments were conducted to examine the
      role of category structure and learning regime in category learning. We
      particularly focused on effects of these factors on selective attention, which
      was measured by eye-tracking methods. Results show that even though supervision
      was weaker than in previous studies, attention optimization and cost of attention
      were observed during category learning (Experiment 1). Moreover, there were
      faster learning and stronger attention optimization when statistically denser
      categories were learned (Experiment 2). At the same time, there were weaker costs
      of selective attention when learning denser categories than when learning sparser
      categories.  Results are discussed in relation to theories of category
      learning.</p>
