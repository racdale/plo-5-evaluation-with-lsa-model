	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined how the intrinsic orientation of spatial layouts and
      the conversational partner&#8217;s viewpoint shape how people organize spatial
      information in memory and subsequently describe it. In 24 pairs, Directors first
      studied an array with a symmetrical structure while either knowing their
      Matcher&#8217;s subsequent viewpoint or not. When describing the array to the
      Matcher, the array&#8217;s intrinsic orientation was aligned with the Director,
      the Matcher, or neither partner. Memory tests preceding descriptions revealed
      that Directors misaligned with the structure organized information according to a
      priori knowledge, being more likely to use the structure as an organizing
      orientation when knowing that Matchers were aligned with it. The perspective of
      Directors&#8217; descriptions was also influenced both by the partners&#8217;
      alignment with the structure and their advance knowledge of that. Altogether,
      speakers are guided by converging social and representational cues to adapt
      flexibly the organization of their memories and perspectives of their
      descriptions. </p>
