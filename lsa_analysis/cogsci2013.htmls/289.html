	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many decisions under risk and uncertainty are made under physical
      or emotional stress. Recent research suggests that stress influences decisions
      between risky options, but that the direction of the influence depends on the
      characteristics of the gambles. For instance, stress increases risk taking for
      loss gambles, but decreases risk taking for gain gambles. In the current project
      we investigate: (1) whether the riskiness of gambles influences the direction of
      the stress effect and (2) whether changes in risk taking can be linked to changes
      in attention. Participants who gave relatively more attention to gains than to
      losses, as indicated by eye- tracking data, were more risk seeking than
      participants who gave less attention to gains. Stress did not influence
      participants&#8217; attention. However, stressed participants became more risk
      seeking when considering gambles with relatively low risk, but less risk seeking
      for gambles with relatively high risk.</p>
