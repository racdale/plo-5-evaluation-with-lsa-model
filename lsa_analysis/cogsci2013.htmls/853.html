	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Categorical perception describes the phenomenon that visual
      stimuli can be discriminated more easily when they belong to distinct rather than
      common linguistic categories. Here we investigate the role of the meaningfulness
      of linguistic categories in categorical perception. To disentangle the effects of
      labels and semantic contents of verbal categories we employed a learning paradigm
      in which participants acquired information about initially unfamiliar objects.
      Linguistic knowledge was manipulated by labeling object pairs either with the
      same or different names. Furthermore, the labels could be associated with
      in-depth knowledge or learned in isolation. Two days after learning, the EEG was
      recorded while participants performed a lateralized object discrimination task.
      Verbal labels affected object processing already at about 120 ms, unaffected by
      semantics, while separate semantic effects were found at about 200 ms, suggesting
      that the influence of verbal categories on perception may not be modulated by
      semantic information associated with the categories.</p>
