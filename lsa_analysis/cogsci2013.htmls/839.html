	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This work investigates why the psych sentence 'She is dizzy' with
      the third person subject in PRESENT fine, whereas its counterparts in Korean and
      Japanese are odd unlike the first person subject utterance na-nun ecirew-e (K)
      &#8216;I am dizzy.&#8217; We have no way of knowing if others&#8217; internal
      psych state is such at speech time. We argue that an evidence acquisition event
      (ee.a) such as I just heard from Mary/I just saw Mary precedes or is accommodated
      prior to speech time for the third person present psych sentence even in English.
      The PRESENT realization is a consequence of &#8220;double access&#8221; sequence
      of tense interpretation in English, i.e. Mary was dizzy and still is dizzy. A
      psych predicate requires the 1st person Experiencer&#8217;s direct perceptual
      experience of one&#8217;s own psych state or of individual object as in
      predicates of personal taste. First-person interoceptive psych judgments of I am
      dizzy/in pain have &#8220;immunity to error through misidentification,&#8221;
      unlike de se thoughts.</p>
