	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study extends the learning and use of affordances on robots
      on two fronts. First, we use the very same affordance learning framework that was
      used for learning the affordances of inanimate things to learn social
      affordances, that is affordances whose existence requires the presence of humans.
      Second, we use the learned affordances for making multi-step plans. Specifically,
      an iCub humanoid platform is equipped with a perceptual system to sense objects
      placed on a table, as well as the presence and state of humans in the
      environment, and a behavioral repertoire that consisted of simple object
      manipulations as well as voice behaviors that are uttered simple verbs. After
      interacting with objects and humans, the robot learns a set of affordances with
      which it can make multistep plans towards achieving a demonstrated goal.</p>
