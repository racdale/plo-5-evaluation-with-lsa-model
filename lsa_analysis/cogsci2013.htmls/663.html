	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In inductive learning, the order in which concept instances are
      presented plays an important role in learning performance. Theories predict that
      interleaving instances of different con- cepts is especially beneficial if the
      concepts are highly sim- ilar to each other, whereas blocking instances belonging
      to the same concept provides an advantage for learning low- similarity concept
      structures. This leaves open the question of the relative influence of similarity
      on interleaved versus blocked presentation. To answer this question, we pit
      within- and between-category similarity effects against each other in a rich
      categorization task called Physical Bongard Problems. We manipulate the
      similarity of instances shown temporally close to each other with blocked and
      interleaved presentation. The results indicate a stronger effect of similarity on
      interleaving than on blocking. They further show a large benefit of com- paring
      similar between-category instances on concept learning tasks where the feature
      dimensions are not known in advance but have to be constructed.</p>
