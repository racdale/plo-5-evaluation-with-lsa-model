	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We have recently created the world's largest biologically
      realistic brain model that is capable of performing tasks (Eliasmith et al.,
      2012). This model uses 2.5 million spiking neurons, takes visual input from a
      28x28 pixel visual field, and controls a physically modelled arm. By presenting
      different visual inputs, the model can perform eight different tasks, including
      memorizing and writing a list of numbers, single-digit addition via counting, and
      flexible pattern completion in the Raven's Matrices task. This tutorial is meant
      to introduce the software toolkit and theoretical background that would allow
      other researchers to build their own models using the same architecture, allowing
      them to explore other tasks and brain functions. This tool supports a novel
      cognitive architecture (SPA; the Semantic Pointer Architecture) that directly
      connects neuroscience with cognitive science.
