	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Do Chinese and English speakers think about time differently?
      Inconsistent findings have been reported even when the same paradigms were used.
      One of the factors that might have contributed to the inconsistency is
      participants&#8217; reading experience of horizontal and vertical texts. The
      present study manipulated this factor experimentally by randomly assigning
      Chinese participants from Taiwan and China to a reading task involving
      horizontally or vertically arranged texts. A temporal judgment task
      (spatial-temporal association of response codes or STARC) followed the reading
      task immediately. It asked the participants to judge if the event depicted in a
      second picture occurred earlier or later than that depicted in the first.
      Responses were faster when the left keys represented the &#8216;earlier&#8217;
      responses than when the right keys did (a STARC effect). Half of the participants
      responded with a horizontally oriented keypad while the rest with a vertically
      oriented keypad. For the Taiwan participants, the STARC effect was greater when
      the response keys were oriented vertically than horizontally, but no difference
      was observed for the China participants. The results also showed that both
      immediate and lifetime reading experiences modulated the vertical bias. For the
      Taiwan participants, the vertical bias was strong following the vertical prime,
      but it disappeared following the horizontal prime. For the China participants,
      the horizontal prime led to a nonsignificant vertical bias whereas the vertical
      prime brought about a significant horizontal bias. A questionnaire administered
      upon completion of the STARC task indicates that the two groups of participants
      had similar lifetime experience of reading horizontal texts, but the Taiwan
      participants read vertical texts in their life far more frequently than the China
      participants. We conclude that the directionality of orthography and
      speakers&#8217; (immediate and lifetime) reading experience can better explain
      the vertical bias (or the lack of it) in the Chinese speakers.</p>
