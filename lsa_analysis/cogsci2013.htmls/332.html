	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Systematic research of instruction-based conceptual change in
      Mathematics and Science is characterized by examining the effectiveness of a
      particular instructional principle in isolation. It is suggested that the field
      could gain from studying how different instructional principles interact when
      they are combined. The goal of this research was to systematically study the
      combined effects of collaborative learning and hypothesis testing on cognitive
      growth. In a randomized experiment, 496 9th graders solved challenging tasks that
      required fully developed proportional reasoning. Half of them were given the
      opportunity to test their solutions. Based on individual pretests, each student
      was assigned to one of three competency levels (low, medium, high), and randomly
      assigned to either work alone or with a (low, medium, high) peer. The findings
      show that the effectiveness of hypothesis testing are conditioned by fine-grained
      differences in the contingencies between the target student&#8217;s level of
      competence, the peer partner&#8217;s level of competence and the feedback they
      receive from the objective testing device.</p>
