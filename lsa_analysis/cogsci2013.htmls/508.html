	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It has been demonstrated that brief exposure to behavioral
      information is sufficient for making accurate social judgments. Movement
      coordination during social interaction, is one potential cue. Although
      coordination between individuals has been identified, our ability to perceive it
      when making judgments regarding affiliation (friends vs. strangers) is unknown. 
      In the present studies, we investigated how correlated movement contributes to
      observers&#8217; accuracy when judging affiliation. Using correlation map
      analysis to quantify coordination, we showed that individuals familiar with each
      other correlated their movements more frequently. Observers were able to use
      coordination as a cue, but only when the information presented was restricted to
      movement related to speech (i.e. while only viewing faces). These results suggest
      that observed movement coordination is influenced by speech-related movements. We
      suggest that social perception is multi-faceted and cues may be prioritized
      differentially based on availability.</p>
