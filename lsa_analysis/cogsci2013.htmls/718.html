	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Masked repetition has been suggested as the reliable paradigm
      investigating the pre-lexical processing of English words. This suggestion has
      the supportive evidence that masked repetition effects do not interact with word
      frequency. Chinese compound words are the combinations of two constituent
      characters which have independent lexical properties. The lemma model argues that
      the lemmas of constituents would increase masked repetition effects of
      low-frequency compound word when the constituent characters have relative higher
      frequency. To verify this argument, this study manipulated the frequency and the
      morphological aspects of constituent characters. The critical results are the
      increased masked repetition effect of low-frequency coordinative words which have
      at least one high-frequency characters and the null interaction of masked
      repetition effect and word frequency for the compound words having meaningless
      constituents. The approaches to modify the current lemma model are discussed
      according to these findings.</p>
