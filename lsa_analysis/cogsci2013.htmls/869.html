	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Much effort has been devoted to exploring the ways in which
      manipulating attention during encoding influences performance on memory tasks
      (Craik et al., 1996). However, fewer studies have examined the effects of
      manipulating attention during memory retrieval. The purpose of this study was to
      further examine selective attention at retrieval in the young and elderly.
      Younger and older adult participants were exposed to a study list followed by a
      recognition test. Participants made memory decisions under selective attention or
      full attention conditions (Dudukovic et al., 2009). Participants then completed a
      memory test consisting of items that had been previously tested under full
      attention, selective attention, and selectively ignored conditions as well as
      previously untested items. The results suggest that selective attention during
      retrieval does not result in significant costs for memory decisions regardless of
      age group. The results are discussed with reference to current theories of aging,
      attention, and memory.</p>
