	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The paper aims to extend the findings of a previous study
      (Grinberg et al., 2012) exploring the impact of social relations on the
      cooperation in the Prisoner&#8217;s dilemma game. Relations between players are
      manipulated by assigning different roles. The roles embodied the four basic types
      of human relations in line with Fiske&#8217;s relational models theory (Fiske,
      1991): communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing
      (players are assigned roles of team mates, chief and subordinate, partners, and
      opponents, respectively). Cooperation rates, mutual cooperation, mutual
      defection, and payoffs gained were subsequently analyzed and compared for a
      series of forty games. As a result we identified that the market-pricing
      condition is characterized by considerably lower individual and mutual
      cooperation, higher mutual defection and lower payoff in comparison to the
      conditions impersonating the remaining three relational types.</p>
