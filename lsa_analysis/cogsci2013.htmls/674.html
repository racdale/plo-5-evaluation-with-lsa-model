	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study aimed to explore the relationship between
      children&#8217;s sharing behavior and Theory of Mind (ToM) understanding.
      Seventy-four 2 to 4 years old Chinese children participated in 3 tasks using toys
      that could be shared with a puppet that was animated by a female experimenter. On
      each task, the puppet expressed her desire for the items using a series of cues
      that progressively became more communicative. Children&#8217;s ToM understanding
      was assessed with the scale of ToM tasks (Wellman, Fang, Liu, Zhu, & Liu, 2006).
      There were two main findings: (1) younger children relied on more explicit
      communicative cues to share resources with the puppet, while older children
      shared more spontaneously and (2) children&#8217;s sharing behavior was
      positively correlated to their ToM scores, independent of age. Findings suggest
      that preschoolers&#8217; sharing behavior is enhanced by their ToM understanding
      and explicit communicative cues provided by a social partner.</p>
