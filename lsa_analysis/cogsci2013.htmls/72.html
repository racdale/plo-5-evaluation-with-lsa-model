	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Information structure describes how the information is packaged
      within a discourse to optimize information transfer. We addressed the question if
      and how a discourse context modulates the online processing of German
      declaratives. Native speakers of German read fictitious stories that depicted a
      simple action scene of two characters while we recorded event-related brain
      potentials (ERPs). Two types of discourse contexts (topic vs. neutral) were
      compared with regard to the processing of declarative canonical
      subject-before-object (SO) and non-canonical object-before-subject (OS)
      sentences. The preceding topic context only modulated the processing of OS
      sentences. This was indicated by a less pronounced positivity around 500 to 900
      ms for the topic compared to the neutral context. As supported by previous
      research we argue that this context-induced effect in the processing of
      non-canonical sentences reflects reduced processing costs for the integration of
      the discourse relevant topic information into the current discourse model.</p>
