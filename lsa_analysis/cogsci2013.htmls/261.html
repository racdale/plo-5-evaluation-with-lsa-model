	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We analyse data from a very large (n=854064) sample of players of
      an online game involving rapid perception, decision-making and motor responding.
      This data set allows us to connect full details of training history with measures
      of performance, for participants who are engaged for a sustained amount of time
      in effortful practice. We show that lawful relations exist between practice
      amount and subsequent performance, and between practice spacing and subsequent
      performance. This confirms results long established in the literature on skill
      acquisition. Additionally, we show that higher initial variation in performance
      is linked to subsequent higher performance, a result we link to the
      exploration-exploitation trade-off from the computational framework of
      reinforcement learning. We discuss the benefits and opportunities of behavioural
      datasets with very large sample sizes and suggest that this approach could be
      particularly fecund for studies of skill acquisition.</p>
