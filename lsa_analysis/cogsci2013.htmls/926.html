	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this study we manipulated colors and shapes in different blocks
      in order to investigate the differential effect of stable spatial cues on color
      and shape recall. The task involves recency judgment where two items from the
      stream of serially presented stimuli are shown and the subjects have to respond
      by indicating which of them came later in the sequence. Our studies show a clear
      dissociation between color and shape recall. While spatial cues seem to
      facilitate shape recall, they seem to degrade the color recall performance. This
      effect becomes significant for shape-location trials beyond the working memory
      capacity limit of 4 items. The results can be interpreted as if individuation of
      colored objects draws from the same attentional resources as spatial attention
      and the resulting competition degrades performance in serial order judgment
      involving color whereas shape recall does not seem to be subject such
      competition.</p>
