	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Young children tend to map novel words to novel objects even in
      the presence of familiar competitors, a finding that has been dubbed the
      &#8220;disambiguation&#8221; effect. Theoretical accounts of this effect have
      debated whether it is due to initial constraints on children&#8217;s lexicons
      (e.g. a principle of mutual exclusivity) or situation-specific pragmatic
      inferences. We suggest that both could be true. We present a hierarchical
      Bayesian model that implements both situation-level and hierarchical inference,
      and show that both can in principle contribute to disambiguation inferences with
      different levels of strength depending on differ- ences in the situation and
      language experience of the learner. We additionally present data testing a novel
      prediction of this probabilistic view of disambiguation.</p>
