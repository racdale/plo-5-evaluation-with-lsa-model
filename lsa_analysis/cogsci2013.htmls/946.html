	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>After decades of research, the reason why people are attracted to
      the supernatural (paranormal, magical, superstitions) is poorly understood. It is
      possible that the question has been approached from the wrong angle and that it
      is skepticism that needs to be explained, not the beliefs.  Taking this as a
      starting point, we examined (N = 40) whether skeptics have stronger cognitive
      inhibition than believers. Because cognitive load disrupts inhibition and reveals
      intuitive thinking, we hypothesized that working memory load increases
      ontological confusions less among skeptics than among believers.  Ontological
      confusions, such as conceiving of lifeless objects as having mental states, are
      known to be central to supernatural beliefs. The results supported the
      hypothesis.  Strong cognitive inhibition may thus partly explain why supernatural
      beliefs, albeit based on natural information processing, seem so unbelievable to
      millions of people. An ongoing study examines skeptics&#8217; and
      believers&#8217; cognitive inhibition in more detail.</p>
