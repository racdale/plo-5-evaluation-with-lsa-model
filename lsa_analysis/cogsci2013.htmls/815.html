	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Threaded cognition theory predicts that switching is opportunistic
      and depends on availability of cognitive resources. Laboratory studies of
      multitasking suggest people are rational in their switch choices regarding
      multitasking, while observational studies suggest they are not. To establish
      whether effective multitasking can become ineffective we introduced delays in the
      primary task.

      The participants answered emails by looking up information (similar to
      customer-service employees) while being interrupted by chat messages. When
      participants were faced with a delay in the email task, they switched more often
      to the chat task on high-workload points. Choosing to switch to the secondary
      task instead of waiting made them slower. It also made them forget the
      information of the e-mail task half of the time, which slowed them down even
      more.

      We concluded that people&#8217;s rationality in multitasking behavior is only
      local, which agrees with the threaded cognition account of switching.</p>
