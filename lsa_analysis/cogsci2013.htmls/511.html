	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper we present a neural network model of motor learning
      structured around circuits which associate motor actions with their sensory
      effects, as proposed by Hommel et al. (2001). The network implements a novel
      model of causative actions, which bring about specified distal movements in
      manipulated target objects (e.g. bending a lever). It also serves as the basis
      for a novel embodied account of the syntax of causative sentences such as 'John
      bent the lever'.</p>
