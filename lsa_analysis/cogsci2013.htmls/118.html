	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Behavioural findings in several strategic games indicate that
      people punish others if they think they are being treated &#8216;unfairly&#8217;
      even at the cost of minimizing their own material payoff. We investigated the
      primary driving force behind such altruistic cooperation. In Experiment 1, we
      replicated previous findings indicating that the key mechanism contributing to
      the emergence of altruistic cooperation is fairness considerations. In Experiment
      2, we investigated the effect of the opportunity for reputation building and
      future interaction on altruistic cooperation and found that these factors become
      effective only when fairness considerations are removed.</p>
