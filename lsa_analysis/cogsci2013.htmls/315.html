	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Grounded (embodied) theories of cognition propose that memory,
      including knowledge and meaning, is grounded in sensorimotor and mental state
      processes. The main proposed mechanism for how memory is grounded is mental
      simulation. Simulation occurs when neural activity in modal association cortex
      triggers time-locked, recurrent and feedback activity across multiple lower-level
      modal processing areas from which the memory was initially constructed. Through
      this distributed multi-regional activity, seeing an object or reading its name
      (e.g., &#8220;dog&#8221;) re-enacts associated features that were stored during
      earlier learning experiences (e.g. its shape, color, motion, actions with it),
      thereby constructing cognition, memory, and meaning. This paper reviews
      convergent evidence from cognitive neuroscience of mental imagery, object
      cognition, and memory that supports a multi-state interactive (MUSI) account of
      automatic and strategic mental simulation mechanisms that can ground memory,
      including the meaning, of objects in modal processing of visual features.</p>
