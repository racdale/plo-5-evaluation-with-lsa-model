	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research on the psychology of simple, perceptual choices has led
      to an impressive progress in capturing the underlying mental processes as optimal
      mechanisms. Within this theoretical framework, perceptual decisions arise from a
      feed-forward process involving the sampling and accumulation of momentary
      evidence up to a decision boundary. According to this view, the stage where the
      information is accumulated is automatic and decision makers can exert strategic
      control on the decision boundary only, in order to adapt their performance to the
      task demands (e.g. speed-accuracy trade-offs). We present new behavioural and
      eye-tracking data challenging this view and suggesting that the way information
      is accumulated in perceptual decisions, is subject to differential weighing that
      depends on the task framing (e.g. select the brightest or the darkest spot). We
      conclude that choices are mostly influenced by extreme values, and whether
      positive or negative peaks are more pivotal is frame-dependent and subject to
      top-down control.</p>
