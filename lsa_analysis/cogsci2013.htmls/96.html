	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Object segregation in a visual scene is a complex perceptual
      process that relies on the integration of multiple cues. The task is
      computationally challenging, and even the best performing models fall
      significantly short of human performance. Infants initially have a surprisingly
      impoverished set of segregation cues and their ability to perform object
      segregation in static images is severely limited. Major questions that arise are
      therefore how the rich set of useful cues is learned, and what initial capacities
      make this learning possible. Here we present a computational model that initially
      incorporates only two basic capacities known to exist at an early age: the
      grouping of image regions by common motion and the detection of motion
      discontinuities. The model then learns significant aspects of object segregation
      in static images in an entirely unsupervised manner by observing videos of
      objects in motion. Implications of the model to infant learning and to the future
      development of object segregation models are discussed.</p>
