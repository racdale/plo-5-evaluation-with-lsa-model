	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research under the paradigm of the label feedback hypothesis has
      proposed a causal role for verbal labels in the online learning and processing of
      categories. Labeled categories are learned faster, and are subsequently more
      robust. The present study extends this research paradigm by considering the
      relationship between verbal labels and flexible categorization. Flexibility is a
      key trait of human cognition, and flexible categorization is important in a
      number of tasks. Participants learned to categorize &#8216;friendly&#8217; and
      &#8216;unfriendly&#8217; aliens either with or without names, followed by a
      transfer task. While selective attention to a particular dimension slowed
      relearning, no effect of label was found for either category learning or
      relearning with one exception; labels facilitated flexibility when selective
      attention was not involved in the transfer. The inability to replicate effects of
      verbal labels in category learning using similar methodologies raises interesting
      theoretical issues, questioning the extent to which this relationship
      applies.</p>
