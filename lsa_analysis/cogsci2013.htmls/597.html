	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper we investigate the effect of power on prosocial
      decision-making. While previous research has thoroughly investigated this
      relation in Western cultures, we focus our research on the role of power in an
      understudied Middle-Eastern culture. Existing literature suggest an inverse
      relationship between feeling of power and prosocial behavior, where generally
      people in high levels of power tend to act less sympathetically in their
      decisions and demonstrate declined levels of perspective taking towards others.
      Our findings demonstrate that, unlike their Western counterparts, Iranian
      participants show significantly higher levels of altruism when in a high-power
      situation perceived as legitimate. On the other hand, under illegitimate power
      conditions, participants primed with high-power act significantly less
      compassionately in comparison to their low-power counterparts. We believe these
      findings have great impact in studying social hierarchies and behavior in
      cross-cultural settings.</p>
