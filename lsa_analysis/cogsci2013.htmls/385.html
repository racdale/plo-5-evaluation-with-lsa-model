	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper, we examine the impact of three learning activities
      designed to foster more robust learning in a Genetics Cognitive Tutor module on
      pedigree analysis problem solving, in an experimental study. The three activities
      are (1) interleaved worked examples with student explanations; (2) enhanced
      feedback with tutor-provided explanations of problem solving steps; and (3)
      explicit scaffolding of the reasoning steps in this abductive
      process-of-elimination reasoning task. The study included four between-subject
      conditions, a baseline condition in which students exclusively solved standard
      problems, and three conditions in which students engaged in one of the new
      learning activities along with standard problem solving. The scaffolded-reasoning
      condition was most successful in fostering robust learning, as measured by
      transfer, retention, and preparation for future learning tests. The enhanced
      feedback condition, in contrast, yielded the poorest performance on the robust
      learning measures.</p>
