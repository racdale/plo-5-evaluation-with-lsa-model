	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In recent years, computational models have become an increasingly
      important part both of cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience. In tandem
      with these developments neuroscientific and cognitive investigations of musical
      experience and behaviour have been gathering pace. In this context, music
      cognition constitutes a rich and challenging area of cognitive science in which
      the processing of complex, multi-dimensional temporal sequences can be studied
      without interference of meaning or semantics (see Pearce & Rohrmeier, 2012, for a
      review). &#160;Because of its complexity and well-defined problem-space,
      computational modelling of music witnessed a rapid growth of successful
      higher-order modelling approaches. This workshop investigates computational
      modelling as a bridge between cognition and the brain, with a focus on
      understanding the psychological mechanisms involved in perceiving and producing
      music.</p>
