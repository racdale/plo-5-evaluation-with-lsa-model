	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This research demonstrates that preschoolers flexibly trust and
      mistrust the same individuals, as preschoolers recognize that their intentions
      may vary. In Study 1 (N=101) 3- and 4-year-olds trusted speakers based on their
      current, rather than previous, intentions to give in/correct information. Thus
      preschoolers infer the meanings behind different intentions and recognize that
      intentions change within individuals over time. In Study 2 (N=80) 3- to
      5-year-olds trusted speakers who were currently sincere, but previously
      intentionally inaccurate, rather than currently sincere, but previously ignorant,
      showing that preschoolers infer current knowledge from prior intentions.
      Preschoolers also trusted speakers who were currently knowledgeable, although
      previously ignorant, showing that they recognize knowledge is variable within
      individuals. </p>
