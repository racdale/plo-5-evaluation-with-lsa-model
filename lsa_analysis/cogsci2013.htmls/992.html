	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of the study was to investigate confidence in
      classification accuracy during category learning with three levels of
      categorization difficulty based on a simple logical, conjunctive or complex rule.
      Twenty five psychology students participated in the study. Stimuli were
      geometrical figures that varied on three dimensions: shape, colour, and size. We
      analysed differences in absolute accuracy of confidence judgments with respect to
      task difficulty (three levels), learning phase (early, late) and performance
      groups (slow and fast learners). For the simple logical task, we obtained a
      significant main effect of phase and a significant interaction between phase and
      group, suggesting that fast learners achieved higher accuracy earlier. For the
      conjunctive task, the significant main effect of the group showed higher accuracy
      of fast learners. For the complex task, there was a significant interaction
      between phase and group showing that judgment accuracy in slow learners did not
      improve during learning. </p>
