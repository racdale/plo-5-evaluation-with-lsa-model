	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In schools today, students pursue individual academic subjects,
      such as physics, mathematics, and biology. By compartmentalizing these subjects,
      students may not be able to connect concepts from different disciplines
      competently to explain universal phenomena that occur in everyday living. Under
      this view, it is essential to inculcate an overarching philosophy with which one
      can capably unify all taught subjects. We first consider Logical Positivism as an
      overarching philosophy, and the benefits and implications of teaching it to
      students. We then illuminate the importance of inculcating broad-based
      philosophical thinking in students, and discuss how this pedagogical approach
      deepens students&#8217; understanding in, and increases their interest towards,
      the subject matter that they learn, as well as trains students&#8217; abilities
      to examine and interpret natural phenomena in logical ways.</p>
