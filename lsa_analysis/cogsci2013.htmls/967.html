	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Retrieving information from memory improves the long-term
      retention of that information more than continued restudying (e.g., Karpicke &
      Roediger, 2008). We investigate if this testing-effect can be applied to word
      learning during reading by manipulating the sentence context in which words are
      presented. In a within-subject experiment, adult learners without prior knowledge
      of Swahili studied 80 Swahili words and then repeatedly read the words either in
      an L1-context that was uninformative and required the retrieval of word meanings
      from memory to be understood (e.g., &#8220;I use the =funguo=&#8221;) or in a
      rich context that enabled the readers to derive word meanings (e.g., &#8220;I use
      the =funguo= to unlock the door&#8221;). Recall-accuracy and speed for the newly
      learned words were measured during reading as well as immediately and seven days
      after practice to evaluate effects of sentence context and retrieval success
      during reading on the retention of word form and meaning. </p>
