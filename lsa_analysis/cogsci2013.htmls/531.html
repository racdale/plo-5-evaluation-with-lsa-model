	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examined whether language structure or language
      proficiency might influence students&#8217; use of evaluative language in written
      reports, and whether instruction might improve students&#8217; use of evaluative
      language. Reports in Japanese and in English written by second year Japanese
      university students, who had received instruction in academic discourse
      pertaining to critical evaluation, were analyzed for use of evaluative
      statements. This revealed no disadvantage for use of the Japanese language, which
      is considered as having a more indirect structure that may make critical
      evaluation more difficult. English proficiency test scores, however, were found
      to correlate with production of evaluative statements in English, but not in
      Japanese, suggesting that inadequate second language proficiency could limit
      critical evaluation use. The second year students&#8217; use of evaluative
      statements was also found higher than their first year counterparts&#8217; (who
      had not yet received instruction), suggesting that such instruction is beneficial
      for skills development in both languages.</p>
