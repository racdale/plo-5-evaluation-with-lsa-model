	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How are space and time related in the brain? This study contrasts
      two proposals that make different predictions about the interaction between
      spatial and temporal magnitudes. Whereas ATOM implies that their relation is
      symmetric, Metaphor Theory claims it is asymmetric. We investigated whether space
      and time activate overlapping areas of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and
      whether they do so symmetrically or asymmetrically. We measured
      participants&#8217; neural activity while they made temporal and spatial
      judgments on identical visual stimuli. The behavioral results replicated earlier
      observations of a space-time asymmetry: Spatial information influenced temporal
      judgments more than vice versa. The BOLD data indicated that space and time
      activated overlapping IPC clusters and that, consistent with Metaphor Theory,
      this activation was asymmetric: The shared region of IPC was activated more
      during temporal than during spatial judgments. We consider three possible
      interpretations of this neural asymmetry, based on 3 possible functions of
      IPC.</p>
