	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Displacement, which is to express absent objects, is one of the
      important design features of human language. It has not been well considered in
      the context of communication. We conducted a graphical communication experiment
      to investigate displacement in communication. In this experiment, two adults are
      paired, and a sender drew an absent object expressed by an unconventional
      combination of two words, adjective and noun, while a receiver answered what the
      drawing represented. This process was repeated 8 times for one object in each
      pair. The senders usually drew two pictures corresponding to two words,
      respectively. The analysis of results indicated that nouns should be understood
      in advance for understanding adjectives which are difficult to represent by
      drawings. This suggested that in displaced communication source-target mapping
      strategy was used to compose expressions like metaphors, and that identifying
      which expression represents a target was important in order to understand absent
      objects.</p>
