	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A remarkable property of human cognition is the systematic
      co-occurrence of certain cognitive abilities. One challenge for cognitive science
      is to determine the (computational) principles that derive this property as part
      of a broader goal of establishing the foundations of cognitive architecture (i.e.
      the basic processes and modes of combination affording cognitive capacity) for a
      science of cognition. This paper continues a category theory approach to
      compositionality and cognitive capacity that posits universal construction (e.g.,
      products) as a fundamental cognitive architectural component. As shown here,
      products can be modeled in other frameworks, thereby providing a link between an
      abstract computational principle and a concrete cognitive resource needed for
      particular capacities. For example, a network of weighted connections
      implementing a categorical product uses fewer resources when the number of task
      instances sharing a common product structure is greater than two; otherwise it is
      more economic to realize each instance independently. This cross-over may explain
      why human cognition is not always systematic: the cost of universal construction
      may not outweigh its expected gain.</p>
