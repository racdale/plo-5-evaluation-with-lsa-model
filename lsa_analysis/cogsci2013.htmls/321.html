	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Bar graphs and line graphs are commonly used ways of graphical
      communication. Due to the difference in their perceptual visuo-spatial
      properties, they facilitate comprehension of different events. Bar graphs are
      commonly used in the domain of precipitation although the data intrinsically
      carry information that is averaged over long time spans. In this study, we
      investigate how the presence of incongruence between consecutive graph pairs
      influences conceptualization of the represented information about precipitation.
      For this, we analyzed gestures and verbal descriptions produced by the
      participants as indicators of event conceptualizations. The results of the
      experimental investigation reveals that when incongruent graph pairs are
      presented, the participants show tendency to produce directional gestures that
      accompany the verbal descriptions of the specific regions represented by one/two
      bars. Additionally, the presence of incongruence seems to enhance the production
      of comparative words accompanied with non-directional gestures.  </p>
