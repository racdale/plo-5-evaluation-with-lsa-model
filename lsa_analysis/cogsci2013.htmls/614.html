	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Speakers of morphologically-rich language commonly face what has
      been called the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem (Ackerman et al. 2009): they know
      some form of a word but it is inappropriate to the current context, leading them
      to derive a form of that word they have never encountered (e.g., they know the
      singular form of a noun, and now need to produce the plural). We suggest that in
      performing this task speakers perseverate on articulatory gestures comprising the
      form they know, and that gestures vary in the extent to which speakers
      perseverate on them. This proposal explains the parallels between findings in
      loanword adaptation, speech errors, and acquisition of phonology. New
      experimental data from a miniature artificial language are also presented</p>
