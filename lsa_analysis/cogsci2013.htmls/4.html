	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The goal of Women in Cognitive Science (WICS) is to increase
      attention to the situation of women cognitive scientists, to better understand
      the reasons for existing problems of under representation in key positions, and
      to provide a forum for professional development that encourages both junior and
      senior male and female scientists to consider the ways in which they might work
      with their own home institutions to effect change.
      The CSS 2013 interactive panel discussion will bring together American and
      European researchers in Cognitive Science to discuss national and international
      collaborations as a tool toward professional advancement and visibility and why
      this is important to one's career development. Invited speakers include R. Harald
      Baayen (Eberhard Karls University, T&#252;bingen), Melody Dye (Indiana
      University, Bloomington), Pernille Hemmer (Rutgers University), Lael Schooler
      (Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin), Anne Warlaumont,
      (University, of California, Merced). Speakers will describe and contrast varied
      ways to initiate and goals for international and virtual collaborations. *Laurie
      Feldman will serve as moderator.
