	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>That there is a rapid expansion of online education is much
      better understood than what its consequences will be. This
      symposium considers that one key feature of &#8220;real-world&#8221;
      education that takes place on the Internet is that it provides a
      high level of experimental control and automatic data
      collection & analysis, which can support cognitive science
      research that was previously only possible in laboratory
      settings and small-scale educational environments. The
      presenters discuss the unprecedented opportunities online
      learning provides for conducting research in ecologically
      valid contexts: linking existing laboratory experiments to
      relevant online contexts, personalizing adaptive instruction,
      embedding in vivo research studies of education, and using
      the vast amount of high quality data available. The product of
      such work is not only theories and empirical discoveries that
      better characterize learning, but also the opportunity to
      directly translate these into practical benefits to students
      through concrete improvements to educational resources.</p>
