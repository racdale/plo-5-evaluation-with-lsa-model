	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How does language shape thought? In particular, do
      cross-linguistic differences in how explanations are requested affect how
      explanations are evaluated by speakers of different languages? To address this
      question we contrasted English with Turkish, which has three distinct words that
      correspond to &#8220;why?&#8221; in English. Through two corpus studies and an
      experimental study, we established that Turkish &#8220;why&#8221; questions tend
      to appear in different contexts and elicit different kinds of explanations: the
      &#8220;why&#8221; questions vary in the frequency with which they refer to agents
      and elicit teleological explanations. In an experimental study investigating
      whether this cross-linguistic difference affects how explanations are evaluated,
      we found that while English speakers displayed an overall preference for
      mechanistic explanations in evaluating the stimuli, Turkish speakers provided
      similar satisfaction ratings for mechanistic and teleological explanations. Our
      findings have implications for the cognitive science of explanation and for
      debates about language and thought.</p>
