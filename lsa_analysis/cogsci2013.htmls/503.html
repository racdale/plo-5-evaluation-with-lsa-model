	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Experts and intermediates fundamentally differ in the ways they
      explain subject matter to novices. Experts provide less details but in a highly
      coherent format, whereas intermediates provide many additional details but in a
      format with low coherency. In a recent study, we found that experts&#8217;
      explanations enabled novices to acquire more transferable and flexible knowledge
      as opposed to explanations by intermediates mainly due to the higher coherence of
      experts&#8217; explanations. In order to investigate more directly how
      experts&#8217; and intermediates&#8217; explanations differently triggered
      novices&#8217; processing of the explanations, we conducted a think-aloud study.
      Results indicated that novices learning with an expert&#8217;s explanation
      processed the explanations deeper than novices with intermediates&#8217;
      explanations. In line with this, deep processing was significantly related to
      novices&#8217; transfer. Thus, expertise can be regarded as an essential
      prerequisite for generating effective instructional explanations that engage
      novices to process the subject matter deeply and to generate transferable
      knowledge.</p>
