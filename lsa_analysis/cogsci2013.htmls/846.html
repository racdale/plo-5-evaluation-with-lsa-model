	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Memory processes play a major role in many models of decision
      making. Several fast-and-frugal heuristics assume a sequential search of
      information in memory (e.g. the take-the-best heuristic). Fast-and-frugal
      heuristics exploit regularities in the structure of the environment and basic
      cognitive capacities, such as memory. However, until now only few attempts have
      been made to relate models of memory and decision making to the structure of
      information in the environment. The ACT-R architecture provides a quantitative
      theory about the interplay between the information structure in the environment
      and the memory system. Based on internet statistics, we use ACT-R to predict
      people&#180;s recognition and knowledge about objects in the world, as well as
      the associated retrieval time distributions of respective memories. We show how a
      corresponding model integrating memory and decision processes within ACT-R allows
      predictions about the ecological rationality of decision strategies that operate
      on the accessibility of information in memory. </p>
