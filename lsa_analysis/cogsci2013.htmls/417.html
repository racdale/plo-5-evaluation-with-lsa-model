	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The current study investigated whether children and adults can
      distinguish between actions they are afforded and those afforded to an actor.
      Participants judged the maximum height they could reach while jumping and they
      judged the maximum height that the actor could reach while jumping. They did so
      with and without a weighted backpack, and they did so with and without walking
      several laps. Results show that before the addition of the weighted backpack,
      participants rated the actor&#8217;s abilities as much closer to their own. While
      wearing the weighted backpack and then walking with it, participants&#8217;
      estimates decreased for themselves, but remained mostly unchanged for the
      adult.</p>
