	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>I argue that linear correlations between log word frequency,and
      lexical measures, cannot be taken as evidence for a "Principle of Minimum
      Effort". The Principle of Maximum Entropy  indicates that such relations are in
      fact the ones most probable to be found. For such claims, one needs to compare
      the correlations with adequate baselines reflecting what would be expected in a
      purely random system. I then introduce a way of computing such baselines, and use
      it to show that the correlations found in a corpus are actually weaker than what
      one would expect to find by chance. Therefore, if an argument were to be made
      based on them, it would paradoxically be that language is worse for communication
      than what one would expect to find in a random system. More appropriately
      however, what these results reflect is that such correlations are not the best
      places to look for linguistic optimality.</p>
