	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study explores how people learn about a causal system
      by interacting with it. Participants were given the task to identify the
      operation of virtual '"computer chips" by setting the value of various components
      and observing how those interventions influenced the setting of other components.
      Across conditions we manipulate the complexity of the causal system (i.e., number
      of nodes and connections), the number of alternative hypotheses (i.e. possible
      causal graphs) on each trial, and aspects of the "temporal stability" of the
      learning environment (if repeated interventions were made on a single, stationary
      system or if the system reset to different starting states following each
      intervention). Interventions were modeled by comparing them to an optimal
      Bayesian learner who chooses interventions to quickly reduce uncertainty about
      the structure. Our results suggest that naive Internet-recruited subjects choose
      highly informative interventions, but also deviate from the predictions of the
      optimal model in certain ways.</p>
