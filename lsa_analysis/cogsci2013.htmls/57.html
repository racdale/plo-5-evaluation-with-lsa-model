	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We set forth to show that lexical connectivity plays a role in
      understanding early word learning. By considering words that are learned in
      temporal proximity to one another to be related, we are able to better predict
      the words next learned by toddlers. We build conditional probability models based
      on data from the growing vocabularies of 77 toddlers, followed longitudinally for
      a year. This type of conditional probability model outperforms the current norms
      based on baseline probabilities of learning given age alone. This is a first step
      to capturing the interaction between a child&#8217;s productive vocabulary and
      their learning environment in order to understand what words a child might learn
      next. We also test different types of variants of this conditional probability
      and find that not only is there information in words that are learned in
      proximity to one another but that it matters how models integrate this
      information. The application of this work may provide better cognitive models of
      acquisition and perhaps allow us to detect children at risk for enduring language
      difficulties earlier and more accurately.</p>
