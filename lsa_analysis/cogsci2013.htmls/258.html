	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A recent paper by Lev-Ari and Keysar (2010) reported that the
      processing fluency associated with non-native speech causes non-native speakers
      to sound less credible. The authors found that the same trivia statements were
      rated as less truthful when spoken by a non-native speaker of English. The
      present paper reports the results of three studies that attempted to replicate
      the findings of Lev-Ari and Keysar (2010) by focusing on processing fluency
      manipulations other than accent. Although we used virtually the same methodology
      as Lev-Ari and Keysar (2010), we failed to replicate the key finding that
      foreign-accented speech is less credible than native-accented speech. The
      implications of this finding is discussed.</p>
