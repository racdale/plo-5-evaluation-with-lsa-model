	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examines whether an art course with various kinds of
      inspiration derived from others and their artworks is useful in improving
      undergraduates&#8217; photographic creativity and their views of photo taking. In
      collaboration with a professional photographer, we organized an undergraduate
      course in artistic photography, which included lecture sessions in basic artistic
      skills and knowledge, imitation sessions of unfamiliar artistic photographs,
      photo taking sessions, and presentation of the students' own works in the class.
      21 students participated in the course for a semester. We collected
      students&#8217; diaries of their photo taking, their photographs, and
      questionnaire survey data about their photo taking experiences. The results of
      data analyses show that the creativity of the students&#8217; photographs
      improved after lecture sessions. The students reported that reflecting on their
      photography contributed to their acquisition of metacognitive knowledge of
      artistic creation.</p>
