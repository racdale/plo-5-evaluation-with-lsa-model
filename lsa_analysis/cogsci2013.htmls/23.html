	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The Annual Glushko Dissertation Prize in Cognitive
      Science was established in 2011 as a way to promote future
      growth in cognitive science, and encourage students to
      engage in interdisciplinary efforts to understand minds. The
      prize is jointly sponsored by the Cognitive Science Society
      and the Robert J. Glushko and Pamela Samuelson Foundation,
      and honors young researchers conducting ground
      breaking research in cognitive science. The immediate goal
      is to recognize outstanding efforts to bridge between the
      areas that impinge on cognitive science and create theories
      of general interest to the multiple fields concerned with
      scientifically understanding the nature of minds and
      intelligent systems. Encouraging junior researchers to
      engage in these enterprises is one of the best ways to assure
      a robust future for cognitive science. The overarching goal
      is to promote a unified cognitive science, consistent with the
      belief that understanding how minds work will require the
      synthesis of many different empirical methods, formal tools,
      and analytic theories.
      This symposium showcases the PhD research projects
      of the 2013 winners of the Glushko Dissertation Prizes.
      2013 marks the first year that a symposium has been formed
      to assemble and showcase Glushko Prize winners&#8217; research.
      The prize-winning projects involve research on linguistic
      compositionality, understanding pictorial narratives, learning
      object-to-name mappings from complex environments,
      spatial problem solving, and visual awareness. The recruited
      research methods include neuroimaging, computational
      modeling, formal linguistic modeling, corpus analysis,
      psychological experiments, and theoretical analysis. Taken
      as a whole, the research projects strongly reinforces the
      view that contemporary cognitive science research is highly
      diverse, rigorous, creative, and fertile.</p>
