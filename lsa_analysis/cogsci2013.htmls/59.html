	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Fairness and efficiency are important aspects that influence
      cooperation in social dilemmas. During a repeated interaction, they have the
      potential to serve as competing goals for the decision maker. The ability to
      balance between fairness and efficiency depends, among other things, on available
      information regarding mutual accountability for the outcomes in an interaction.
      In this paper, we examine how information regarding mutual interdependencies
      influences the interplay between fairness and efficiency in repeated Chicken
      Game. We distinguish between three possible types of fair behavior: mutual
      cooperation, alternating cooperation, and mutual destruction. Our results show
      that the first two types of fairness are positively correlated with the
      availability of social information. In contrast, mutual destructive fairness is
      not sensitive to the availability of information and is generally avoided. We
      also find that without information regarding mutual interdependencies, unfairness
      increases in parallel with efficiency. When social information is available,
      however, increases in fairness is coupled with a decrease in efficiency, and the
      best compromise between fairness and efficiency is reached when mutual
      interdependencies are learned through repeated experiences. We highlight the
      significance of our results for fair and efficient interaction in repeated social
      interactions.</p>
