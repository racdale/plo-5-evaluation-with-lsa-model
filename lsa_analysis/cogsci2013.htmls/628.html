	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Bayesian inference has been shown to be an efficient mechanism for
      describing models of learning; however, concerns over a lack of constraint in
      Bayesian models (e.g., Jones & Love, 2011) has limited their influence as being a
      description of the &#8216;real&#8217; processes of  human cognition. In this
      paper, we review some of these concerns and argue that cognitive architectures
      can address these concerns by constraining the hypothesis space of Bayesian
      models and providing a biologically-plausible mechanism for setting priors and
      performing inference. This is done in the context of the ACT-R functional
      cognitive architecture (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998), whose sub-symbolic information
      processing is essentially Bayesian. To that end, our focus in this paper is on an
      updated associative learning mechanism for ACT-R that implements the constraints
      of Hebbian-inspired learning in a Bayesian-compatible framework.</p>
