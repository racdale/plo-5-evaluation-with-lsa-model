	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Several approaches to implementing symbol-like represen-
      tations in neurally plausible models have been proposed.
      These approaches include binding through synchrony (Shas-
      tri & Ajjanagadde, 1993), mesh binding (van Der Velde &
      de Kamps, 2006), and conjunctive binding (Smolensky, 1990;
      Plate, 2003). Recent theoretical work has suggested that most
      of these methods will not scale well &#8211; that is, they cannot en-
      code structured representations that use any of the tens of thou-
      sands of terms in the adult lexicon without making implausible
      resource assumptions (Stewart & Eliasmith, 2011; Eliasmith,
      in press). Here we present an approach that will scale appro-
      priately, and which is based on neurally implementing a type
      of Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). Specifically, we con-
      struct a spiking neural network composed of about 2.5 million
      neurons that employs a VSA to encode and decode the main
      lexical relations in WordNet, a semantic network containing
      over 100,000 concepts (Fellbaum, 1998). We experimentally
      demonstrate the capabilities of our model by measuring its per-
      formance on three tasks which test its ability to accurately tra-
      verse the WordNet hierarchy, as well as to decode sentences
      employing any WordNet term while preserving the original
      lexical structure. We argue that these results show that our
      approach is uniquely well-suited to providing a biologically
      plausible, human-scale account of the structured representa-
      tions that underwrite cognition.</p>
