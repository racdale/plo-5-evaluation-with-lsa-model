	<h1>Thematic Music and Context Interact to Affect Inclusion of Schematic Elements During Story Generation</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Listening to a 90-sec excerpt of thematic music (e.g., baby music)
      affects performance in a subsequent generation task by increasing the likelihood
      that concepts associated with the thematic music (e.g., &#8220;Sleep,&#8221;
      &#8220;Baby&#8221;) will be incorporated into the novel product (Sifonis & Fuss,
      2012). The generation task theme (e.g., writing a story about a visit to an alien
      planet versus writing about a visit to an undiscovered, foreign land) also
      interacts with the music theme to affect the degree to which concepts associated
      with the music are incorporated into the generated product.

      The current study tested and supported the hypothesis that listening to thematic
      music activates complex schematic structures. The generation task theme provides
      context, thus affecting the specific manifestation of the thematic elements in
      the generation task (e.g., including concepts associated with a foreign land with
      many children versus those associated with an alien planet with many children).
