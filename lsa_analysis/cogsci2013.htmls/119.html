	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Information distortion is a cognitive bias in sequential
      diagnostic reasoning. Assumptions about the diagnostic validity of later evidence
      are distorted in favor of the leading hypothesis. Therefore the bias contributes
      to a primacy effect. Current parallel constraint satisfaction models account for
      order effects and coherence shifts, but do not explain information distortion. As
      an alternative a new, probabilistic constraint satisfaction model is proposed,
      which considers uncertainty about diagnostic validity by defining probability
      distributions over coherence relations. Simulations based on the new model show
      that by shifting distributions in favor of the leading hypothesis an increase in
      coherence can be achieved. Thus the model is able to explain information
      distortion by assuming a need for coherence. It also accounts for a number of
      other recent findings on clinical diagnostic reasoning. Alternative models and
      necessary future research are discussed.</p>
