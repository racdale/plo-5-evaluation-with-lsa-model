	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Before children acquire the precise definitions of time words,
      like minute and hour, how do they interpret them? And how are such proto-meanings
      acquired in development? Here we present three experiments, and assess
      children&#8217;s early understanding of seven time words: second, minute, hour,
      day, week, month, and year. Our findings indicate that children first learn time
      words as a lexical class, then learn their ordinal relations, but initially have
      little to no knowledge of their relative durations. This understanding emerges
      late in development &#8211; many years after children first start using time
      words in speech &#8211; and in many children does not emerge until they have
      acquired formal definitions for the words.    </p>
