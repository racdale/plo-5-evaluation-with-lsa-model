	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Music is known to have a profound impact on human cognitive and
      emotional response, which in turn are strongly correlated with physiological
      mechanisms. This paper presents a system that is designed to create original
      musical compositions that elicit particular physiological responses. The
      experiments described below demonstrate that the music generated by this system
      is as effective as human-composed music in effecting changes in skin resistance,
      skin temperature, breathing rate, and heart rate. The system is particularly
      adept at composing pieces that elicit target responses in individuals who
      demonstrated predictable responses to training selections.</p>
