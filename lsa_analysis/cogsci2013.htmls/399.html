	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Societies sometimes stick to the status quo instead of switching
      to superior technologies and institutions. Existing explanations often attribute
      this to a coordination failure due to payoff externalities: people may know that
      another alternative is superior but nobody has an incentive to switch unless many
      others do so. We show that a simple learning argument can provide an alternative
      explanation. When people learn about the alternatives from their own experiences
      but tend to adopt the behaviors of others, they will mistakenly learn to believe
      that a popular alternative is superior to a better, but unpopular alternative.
      Our model neither assumes that agents engage in motivated cognition nor that they
      transmit mistaken information to others. Rather, it emphasizes the role of a
      fundamental asymmetry in access to information about popular versus unpopular
      alternatives. Our model thus provides a novel, sampling-based, explanation of how
      conformity in behavior can lead to private acceptance.</p>
