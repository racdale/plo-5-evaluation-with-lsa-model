	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Successful learning from text takes place when the cognitive
      demands of the learning task &#8211; i.e. the comprehension and retention of text
      material &#8211; and the metacognitive demands of the learning task &#8211; i.e.
      the accurate assessment of one&#8217;s own learning process&#8212;are met. The
      present study was designed to investigate text titles &#8211; a factor known to
      affect cognitive learning processes- as well as the timing of keywording tasks
      &#8211; a factor known to affect metacognitive processes &#8211; and their
      effects on metacognitive monitoring and learning outcomes. The results of the
      study showed that both factors affected learning on the cognitive as well as the
      metacognitive level. </p>
