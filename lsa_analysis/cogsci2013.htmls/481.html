	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Humans, as a cooperative species, need to coordinate in order to
      achieve goals that are beyond the ability of one individual. Modeling the
      emergence of coordination can provide ways to understand how successful joint
      action is established. In this paper, we investigate the problem of two agents
      coordinating to move an object to one agent&#8217;s target location through
      complementary action. We formalize the problem using a decision-theoretic
      framework called Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
      (Dec-POMDPs). We utilize multiagent Q-learning as a heuristic to obtain
      reasonable solutions to our problem and investigate how different agent
      architectures, which represent hypotheses about agent abilities and internal
      representations, affect the convergence of the learning process. Our results
      show, in this problem, that agents using external signals or internal
      representations will not only eventually perform better than those that are
      coordinating in physical space alone but also outperform agents that have
      independent knowledge of the goal. We then employ information theoretic measures
      to quantify the restructuring of information flow over the learning process. We
      find that the external environment state varies in its informativeness about
      agents&#8217; actions depending on the agents&#8217; architecture. Finally, we
      discuss how these results, and the modeling technique in general, can address
      questions regarding the origins of communication.</p>
