	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Inspired by a dynamic approach to recognition memory (Cox &
      Shiffrin, 2012), we present results from a recognition memory experiment in which
      the time at which diagnostic information arrives is unconsciously varied. 
      Contrary to the predictions of most models, performance improves when diagnostic
      information is available later, rather than earlier.  These results are accounted
      for by a dynamic model of recognition, where the time at which information starts
      to be accumulated for a recognition decision can vary independently of when
      features are available to be sampled from the test display.  The same model is
      shown to be able to reproduce the priming results of Jacoby & Whitehouse (1989),
      originally attributed to a fluency heuristic.  The ability to account for such
      seemingly disparate results with a single model illustrates the utility of a
      dynamic approach to recognition.</p>
