	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>According to Margaret Gilbert, a joint commitment (JC) is a
      commitment of two or more agents, called the parties of the JC, to engage in a
      common project. Creating a JC often involves an explicit agreement, carried out
      in a conversa-tional interaction through overt communication. We ex-plored
      aspects of such interactions that can be considered as complementary to verbal
      exchanges, focusing on how a JC is managed by the parties by means of emotional
      and other non-verbal bodily expressions. We analyzed three phases of the JC
      lifecycle (creation, maintenance, and violation), and in particular the emotional
      reaction of the participants to two types of violations by the experimenter. In
      our analysis we used standardized tools such as the Ethological Coding System for
      Interviews, the Mind Reading Emotional Library, and the Facial Action Coding
      System. Our results show that certain non-verbal behaviors in the phase of JC
      creation are characteristic of the participants who later did not fulfill their
      commitment. Moreover, the participants&#8217; emotional reactions to JC violation
      by the experimenter turned out to depend on the type of violation. Finally, the
      creation and maintenance of JC, and the emotional reaction to its violation,
      appear to be independent of the participants&#8217; personality and empathic
      disposition.</p>
