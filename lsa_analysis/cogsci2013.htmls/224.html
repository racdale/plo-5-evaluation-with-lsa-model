	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent work on causal learning has investigated the possible role
      of generic priors in guiding human judgments of causal strength. One proposal has
      been that people have a preference for causes that are sparse and
      strong&#8212;i.e., few in number and individually strong (Lu et al., 2008).
      Evidence for the use of sparse-and-strong priors has been obtained using a
      maximally simple causal set-up (a single candidate cause plus unobserved
      background causes). Here we examine the possible impact of generic priors in more
      complex, multi- causal set-ups. Sparse-and-strong priors predict that competition
      can be observed between candidate causes even if they occur independently (i.e.,
      the estimated strength of cause A will be lower if the strength of uncorrelated
      cause B is high rather than low). Experiment 1 revealed such a cue competition
      effect in judgments of causal strength. Experiment 2 showed that, as predicted by
      a Bayesian learning model with sparse-and-strong priors, the impact of the prior
      diminishes as sample size increases. These findings support the importance of a
      preference for parsimony as a constraint on causal learning.</p>
