	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Learning to represent hierarchical structure and its
      nonadjacent dependencies (NDs) is thought to be
      difficult. I present three simulations of ND learning
      using a simple recurrent network (SRN). In Simulation
      1, I show that the model can learn distance-invariant
      representations of nonadjacent dependencies. In
      Simulation 2, I show that purely localist SRNs can
      learn abstract rule-like relationships. In Simulation 3, I
      show that SRNs exhibit facilitated learning when there
      are correlated perceptual and semantic cues to the
      structure (just as people do). Together, these
      simulations show that (contrary to previous claims)
      SRNs are capable of learning abstract and rule-like
      nonadjacent dependencies, and show critical
      perceptual- and semantics-syntax interactions during
      learning. The studies refute the claim that neural
      networks and other associative models are
      fundamentally incapable of representing hierarchical
      structure, and show how recurrent networks can
      provide insight about principles underlying human
      learning and the representation of hierarchical structure.</p>
