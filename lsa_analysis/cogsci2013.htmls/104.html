	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study presents a novel paradigm for testing the
      ability for adults to rapidly learn novel morphological categories in the wake of
      irrelevant information: specifically number markings intermixed with irrelevant
      gender cues. Using an artificial language learning paradigm, participants were
      exposed to picture-sound pairs in which pictures of animals varied by number
      (singular, dual and plural), but with irrelevant gender information intermixed
      with the exposure items (masculine, feminine and neuter). Auditory stimuli were
      presented in CVCVCV forms (e.g., [zovabu]) in which the first two syllables
      denoted the animal (e.g., [zova] for snail) and the final syllable denoted
      number. (e.g., [bu] for single). Results revealed that participants were able to
      learn which category the suffix endings referred to, based on a two-alternative
      forced-choice generalization task. Implications for the learning of complex
      paradigms are discussed.</p>
