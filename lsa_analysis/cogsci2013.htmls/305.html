	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Although word learning unfolds over days, weeks, and months,
      individual naming events are over in a matter of seconds. To benefit from a
      naming event, children must at least hear the label and see the referent. We
      tested 1-, 2- , 3-, and 4-year old children in a naturalistic word learning task
      with two conditions: one that taxed both speech processing and rapid
      gaze-following, and one in which a social cue-to-reference was available for an
      extended time. The development of word-learning in the extended condition
      paralleled the development of speech processing, but learning in the brief
      condition lagged
      behind. However, learning from both the brief and extended cues was predicted by
      individual differences in speech processing and cue-following together. Thus,
      even through the 4th year, real-time processing of social and linguistic
      information are a critical bottleneck for word learning.</p>
