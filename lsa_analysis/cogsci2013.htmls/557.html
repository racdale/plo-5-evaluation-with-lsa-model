	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Prior research has shown that children hold a belief in causal
      determinism - the belief that all events are caused &#8211; by 4 years of age. 
      In this study we investigate the developmental origins of this belief.  We showed
      toddlers (24 months) a spontaneous or explained novel physical outcome (a toy
      that lit up either spontaneously or upon contact from an experimenter) and then
      showed them an additional candidate cause (pressing a button) while obscuring the
      outcome.  We asked whether toddlers inferred that the two components (the button
      and the outcome) were causally linked.  We found that toddlers represented the
      candidate cause as the cause of the novel outcome only when the event
      spontaneously occurred (Experiments 1-2), and that children spontaneously
      searched for plausible causes of unexplained outcomes (Experiment 3).  These
      results suggest that toddlers, like older children, believe physical events have
      causes, and that this belief supports exploration and discovery. </p>
