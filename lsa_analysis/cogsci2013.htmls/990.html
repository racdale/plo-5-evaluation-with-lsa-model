	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Expected words/constituents are often processed faster than
      unexpected words/constituents. In languages like English that verbs are placed
      before arguments that they encode, the occurrence of verbs pre-activates upcoming
      arguments, suggesting that verbs&#8217; arguments are expected upon the
      recognition of verbs. However, this is not the case for languages like Korean
      that verbs are placed after the arguments associated with verbs. This study
      investigated whether argument order might play a role in cuing upcoming
      arguments. Using Hong et al.&#8217;s materials, we conducted a completion study.
      We found that patients were expected when recipients were introduced before,
      whereas recipients were not expected when patients were introduced before,
      suggesting that comprehenders might expect encountering patients after recipients
      but not vice versa. The probability of patients/recipients was correlated with
      the frequency of regressions that Hong et al. observed. We will further examine
      the role of probability and uncertainty in processing in terms of expectation.
