	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The meaning of spatial relations have been intensively studied in
      cognitive science research. A spatial template is one of the typical
      representations of spatial relations, which maps a position of a
      located object to its acceptability for the corresponding spatial
      term. Spatial templates have been investigated for several
      orthogonal spatial relations. However, diagonal spatial relations
      have attracted less attention. The present study aims at empirically
      determining the spatial template for a Japanese diagonal spatial term,
      "migiue (upper right)". The data was collected with various
      geometrical conditions changing the size of objects and the aspect
      ratio of the background. The analysis of the data revealed that the
      reference axis for "migiue (upper right)" was the direction of 45 degrees,
      and the acceptability of the diagonal relation could be affected by
      the acceptable regions of the adjacent orthogonal relations.
