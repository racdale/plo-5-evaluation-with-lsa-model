	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The current experiment investigated the effects of target size and
      symmetry on the dynamics of precision aiming. Participants were asked to sit on a
      chair and point at the center of four different targets (a small and big square
      target, and a horizontal and vertical rectangular target). The aiming movements
      were assessed using linear (root mean square) and non-linear fractal statistics
      (DFA and MFDFA). We found that participants spontaneously exhibited more movement
      in target dimensions with less spatial constraint (i.e., larger target
      dimensions). These larger movements, however, were more deterministic than the
      movements accompanying the smaller targets, indicating that more variation in
      aiming does not necessarily mean more random. Finally, even though
      participants&#8217; movements were multifractal, the different manipulations and
      task constraints had no effect on the width of the multifractal spectrum. These
      results suggest that human performance emerges from the complex relationship and
      interactions that exist between the perception and action capabilities of the
      human body and the physical environment.</p>
