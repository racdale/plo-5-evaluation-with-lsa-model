	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The dimensional change card sort (DCCS) task is a model paradigm
      for studying developmental change attention switching during childhood. In the
      DCCS, children are asked to sort two-dimensional cards (e.g., blue star) by one
      dimension and then again by the other. Typically, 3-year-olds fail to switch
      dimensions, continuing to sort the cards by the first dimension. Four-year-olds
      readily switch dimensions. The source of this sudden developmental change has
      been widely debated. A recent proposal is that only older children are able to
      selectively attend to one dimension, enabling them to flexibly switch the
      dimension along which they sort. We present results showing that experience
      matching values along one dimension prior to participating in the DCCS task
      facilitates 3-year-olds&#8217; ability to switch dimensions. We implemented this
      experience in a dynamic neural field model of DCCS performance and found that it
      mimicked developmental change in dimensional attention in the model. </p>
