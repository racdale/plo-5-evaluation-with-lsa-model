	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Survey spatial representations are map-like mental representations
      in which directional relationships among landmarks are preserved. Survey
      representations allow people not only to re-trace routes already experienced, but
      also to find new routes and shortcuts (Golledge et al., 1999). This study
      investigated whether and to what extent verbal and spatial working memory (WM)
      are implicated in the construction of survey representations. We adopted a
      dual-task paradigm, asking participants to learn a new environment from
      navigation and, concurrently, to perform either a verbal or a spatial task,
      assumed to load verbal and spatial WM, respectively. Ninety undergraduates were
      assigned to one of three groups according to concurrent task condition:
      articulatory suppression, spatial tapping, or control (no concurrent task).
      Acquisition of a survey representation was tested by asking participants to
      perform direction estimations and shortcut tasks. The results supported the
      involvement of spatial WM in the acquisition of survey knowledge, showing
      significant differences between the spatial tapping group and control group for
      the survey measures.
