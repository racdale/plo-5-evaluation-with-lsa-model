	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In our daily social interactions we can infer others people
      intentions from the observation of their actions. In general, two brain systems,
      the mentalizing and the mirror neuron system, have been implicated in
      understanding other&#8217;s intentions. However, there is little knowledge
      whether and how these two systems may cooperate in correctly understanding
      communicative interactions. We used functional MRI to establish how mirror and
      mentalizing regions contribute to the implicit encoding of communicative
      intentions, proposing that being directly involved during social interaction
      would be mediated by both systems. In particular, we investigated the involvement
      of those systems in distinguishing communicative from private intentions as well
      as other directed (&#8220;third-person perspective&#8221;) from self-directed
      (&#8220;second-person perspective&#8221;) intentions. Categorical and functional
      connectivity analyses showed that the mentalizing and the mirror neurons system
      were simultaneously involved in processing communicative intentions in general
      and more strongly coupled in self directed communicative actions. </p>
