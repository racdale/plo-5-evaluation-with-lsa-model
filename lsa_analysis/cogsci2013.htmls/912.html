	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The challenge of integration of virtual agents and co-robots into
      the human society requires for these future artifacts to become human-compatible,
      in addition to being generally intelligent and capable of providing specific
      expertise. Specifically, a human-compatible agent should be able to induce in
      humans a sense of co-presence of a potentially equal mind capable of mutual
      understanding and human-like learning, long-term personal relationships and
      generous initiative. Achieving these qualities requires social emotional
      intelligence. In order to be able to implement equivalents of social emotions in
      artifacts, it is vital to better understand social interactions in small groups
      based on cognitive architectures like eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The present work
      makes one step further in this direction, continuing the development and
      computational exploration of the new framework for emotional cognitive
      architectures. In the focus are relationships of trust and mutual respect,
      leadership and allegiance, and related to them social and complex emotions.</p>
