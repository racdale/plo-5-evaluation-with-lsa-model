	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Can linguistic structures influence how people perceive and
      remember causal events? Using a change-detection method, we presented
      participants with direct causal scenes paired with either transitive (He
      stretched the toy) or periphrastic sentences (He made the toy stretch.)
      Participants then viewed movies with changes to the manner of action (stretching
      the toy with palms up vs. down), the result (stretching it a shorter vs. longer
      distance), or no change. Participants judged whether the two movies were
      identical. Reading periphrastic sentences made people more likely to notice a
      change in manner than a change in result. Reading transitive sentences had the
      reverse effect &#8211; participants were more likely to notice changes in result.
      This work provides an important advance in our understanding of how rich
      conceptual representations map into the grammatical structures of language. We
      discuss how this novel method can provide insight into the nonlinguistic
      representations recruited by particular sentence structures.</p>
