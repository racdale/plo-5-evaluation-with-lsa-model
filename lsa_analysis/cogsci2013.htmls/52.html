	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Theories of embodied cognition suggest that sensorimotor processes
      are involved in language comprehension processes. Recent studies suggested that
      sentences referring to actions that involve a typical effector (e.g. &#8220;He
      kicks the ball&#8221;) can systematically activate motor cortex areas that are
      involved in performing such actions (Hauk, Johnsrude & Pulverm&#252;ller, 2004).
      In behavioral studies, there is mixed evidence regarding the effects of
      effector-specific words on corresponding actions.  In the current study, we
      investigated the effect of four word groups on subsequent motor responses
      involving the hand or the foot. The four word groups were (a) action verbs (e.g.,
      kick, grasp) (b) nouns containing the lexeme &#8216;hand&#8217; or
      &#8216;foot&#8217; (e.g., handball, football) (c) nouns referring to objects that
      are typically manipulated by hand or foot (e.g., cup, shoe), and (d) as control
      items, nouns that have a spatial association with the upper or lower space (e.g.,
      eagle, root) and which are known to activate locational information in paradigms
      where no reading is required. We found strong effector-specific compatibility
      effects revealing a facilitation effect in all noun-groups. Surprisingly, this
      effect was not present for the action-verbs. Implications of these findings will
      be discussed.</p>
