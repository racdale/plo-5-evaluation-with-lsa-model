	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research has shown that gestures produced by caregivers
      and teachers facilitate children&#8217;s learning in problem-solving tasks.
      However, little is known about whether such facilitating effect varies with the
      task difficulty. We here asked twenty-eight three-year-old children to
      participate in two puzzle games (12-piece and 20-piece), with three episodes in
      each game. In Episodes 1 and 3, children played alone. In Episode 2, caregivers
      instructed their children (e.g., &#8220;Let&#8217;s put this piece upside
      down&#8221; while rotating left hand clockwise). For both puzzle games, children
      assembled more puzzles in Episode 3 than in Episode 1, suggesting that
      caregivers&#8217; instructions were beneficial for children&#8217;s learning.
      However, such benefit was significantly greater in 12-piece than in 20-piece,
      t(27)=1.71, p&lt;.05. This finding lends support to Vygotsky&#8217;s theory in
      which children can gain more from caregiver&#8217;s scaffolding when the task is
      within their capacity than when the task is beyond their capacity. </p>
