	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Self-explanation (SE) is an effective strategy for improving
      understanding and it relied on learners&#8217; proper deployment of prior
      knowledge. Surprisingly, there is limited research on how might misconceptions
      affects learning despite they are inherent part of learners&#8217; knowledge
      system. We examine the influence of SE on processes and outcomes of science
      learning for 36 sixth grade students by varying degrees of prior knowledge and
      relevant misconceptions. The SE group read and self-explained a text describing
      state changes of water requiring proper notions of molecules while the control
      group read twice and think aloud. The results indicated that there are no effects
      of SE, prior knowledge for learning outcomes. However there is significant effect
      of SE by misconception interaction. Low misconception students benefit from SE
      but not for high misconception counterparts. SE did influence amounts and types
      of verbal protocol students generated. The results indicated that the influence
      of SE heavily modulated by learners&#8217; misconceptions.</p>
