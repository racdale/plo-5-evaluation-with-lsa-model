	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Learning a particular categorization leads to corresponding
      changes in the similarity structure of the categorized stimuli. The purpose of
      the current study was to examine whether different category structures may lead
      to greater or less similarity change. We created six category structures and
      examined changes in similarity as a result of categorization in
      between-participant conditions. The best-supported hypothesis was that the ease
      of learning a categorization affects change in similarity, with the most change
      following learning of difficult category structures. There was also support for
      the hypothesis that similarity change is more likely to occur when the category
      boundary was not aligned with the physical dimension of variation. Finally, we
      discuss some methodological challenges in addressing this important research
      topic. </p>
