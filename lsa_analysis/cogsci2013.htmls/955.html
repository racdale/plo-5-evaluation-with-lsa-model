	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Listeners customize speech processing to accommodate
      talker-specific phonetic variation. For example, listeners modify established
      phonetic boundaries to incorporate a talker&#8217;s idiosyncratic productions. In
      addition to being marked by boundaries, phonetic categories exhibit a graded
      internal structure, with some members of the category considered better members
      than others. Here we examined whether sensitivity to talker-specific phonetic
      variation influences internal category structure. Two groups of listeners heard a
      talker produce /k/. Word-initial voice-onset-time (VOT) was manipulated such that
      one group heard the talker produce /k/ with shorter VOTs relative to the other.
      Listeners were then presented with a range of VOTs and asked to rate each for
      goodness as /k/. Results to date indicate that exposure during training robustly
      influences the range of VOTs considered the best exemplars of /k/, suggesting
      that accommodating talker-specific phonetic variation results in a comprehensive
      re-mapping of acoustic-phonetic space and is not limited to the boundary
      region.</p>
