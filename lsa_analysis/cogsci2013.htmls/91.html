	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Does a middle school mathematics curriculum that is redesigned
      using principles based in cognitive research improve student outcomes?  To test
      whether research can be effectively translated into practice, the Connected
      Mathematics Project 2 (CMP2) curriculum was revised according to four principles
      1) mapping verbal-visual information, 2) interleaving worked examples, 3) spacing
      learning over time and 4) using formative assessment. This study of 6th grade and
      8th grade mathematics education addresses the research question, &#8220;Do
      students who are exposed to specific redesigned CMP2 curriculum modules
      (treatment) exhibit greater improvements in mathematics performance in the
      module-specific content area than their counterparts exposed to the regular CMP2
      curriculum (control)?&#8221; Preliminary analyses show statistically significant
      effects of the redesigned CMP2 units in three of the four curricular units in
      this study.</p>
