	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Aim of the present study is to investigate whether and to what
      extent movements performed with the whole body can influence calculation
      processes. Participants were asked to perform additions or subtractions while
      executing an ascending or descending movement in a passive (i.e., by taking the
      elevator) or active (i.e., by taking the stairs) mode. Results revealed a
      congruency effect between the type of calculation made and the direction of the
      movement performed, but only when participants experienced it through a passive
      mode. Our data are in line with studies providing evidence of a strict link
      between numerical and spatial representations, and between motor actions and
      number magnitude processing (motor-to-semantic effect). Implications of the
      results for the embodied and grounded nature of numerical cognition will be
      considered and discussed.</p>
