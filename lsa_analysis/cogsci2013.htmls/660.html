	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Perspective plays a large role in how we think about space. Does
      perspective also influence how we think about abstract concepts, such as
      time&#8212;which is closely associated with how we think about space? Linguistic
      patterns suggest that speakers talk about temporal sequences from two
      perspectives: field-based and ego perspective (Moore, 2011). However, the
      psychological reality of these mappings beyond their use in language is unclear.
      The present study examines whether sequential reasoning recruits the sagittal
      axis differently, depending on the perspective adopted. We manipulated
      perspective by using pronouns meant to evoke a field-based or ego perspective
      (&#8220;her&#8221; vs &#8220;your&#8221;, respectively). Participants made
      earlier-than or later-than judgments about event sequences using a mouse in front
      of or behind their body. We observed an interaction between pronoun, temporal
      reference, and response location. Participants map space onto time differently
      depending on the frame of reference from which temporal sequences are
      interpreted. </p>
