	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Whether categorical perception of color is lateralized in the left
      cerebral hemisphere (e.g., Gilbert, Regier, Kay, & Ivry, 2006) or not (e.g.,
      Witzel & Gegenfurtner, 2011) is still controversial. This ongoing debate,
      however, has been studied with visual search tasks, which seemed to produce
      residual laterality effects. The present study assessed whether a delayed
      discrimination task with divided visual field method, rather than visual search
      tasks, yields lateralized or bilateral categorical perception of color. The
      results showed an advantage for between-category discrimination relative to
      within-category discrimination. Such an advantage, importantly, was obtained in
      the left visual field as well as in the right visual field. These results suggest
      categorical perception of color is bilateral and not lateralized. Combining
      recent studies with visual search tasks (e.g., Witzel & Gegenfurtner, 2011), our
      results would provide further evidence for bilateral categorical perception, and
      thus throw doubt on the laterality effects of categorical perception.</p>
