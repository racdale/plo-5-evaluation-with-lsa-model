	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Two experiments in the visual world paradigm investigated
      competition in sentence processing from dynamic event-related information about
      location. In Experiment 1, listeners viewed visual arrays with container objects
      like a bowl, jar, pan, and jug, while they heard sentences like &#8220;The boy
      will pour the sweetcorn from the bowl into the jar, and he will pour the gravy
      from the pan into the jug. But first/And then, he will taste the
      sweetcorn.&#8221; While &#8220;But first&#8221; contexts referred to the
      &#8220;source&#8221; location of the discourse-final noun (e.g.,
      &#8220;sweetcorn&#8221;), &#8220;And then&#8221; contexts referred to its
      &#8220;goal&#8221; location. In Experiment 2, listeners always heard &#8220;And
      then&#8221; contexts. We found that listeners rapidly fixated context-relevant
      locations. Crucially, they also fixated locations that were context-irrelevant,
      but related to the discourse-final noun, suggesting object competition, or
      consistent with abstract location information implied by &#8220;But first&#8221;
      (source) or &#8220;And then&#8221; (goal), suggesting location competition.</p>
