	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study looked at whether toddlers posit the existence of
      unobserved causes when events occur probabilistically.  Older (18-24 months) and
      younger (12-17 months) children were introduced to novel events.  An experimenter
      pressed a red handle and a lollipop emerged from a box; she then pressed a green
      handle and a cake emerged. These events were repeated three times. On the fourth
      trial, the experimenter switched either the order or relationship between events.
       In the Deterministic condition, the experimenter pressed the green handle first
      and the red handle second; in the Probabilistic condition, the red handle
      produced the cake and the green handle produced the lollipop. On the test trial,
      the experimenter pressed the red handle and a hand emerged, holding the lollipop.
       The older toddlers looked longer at the hand in the Deterministic than the
      Probabilistic condition, suggesting they inferred a hidden cause when the events
      occurred probabilistically.</p>
