	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Philosophers traditionally held that knowledge is justified true
      belief. Gettier (1963) challenged this view with thought experiments in which
      someone has a justified and true belief, but an element of luck is involved that
      disqualifies the belief from counting as knowledge. We examined laypeople&#8217;s
      concept of knowledge using a semantic integration paradigm modeled after that of
      Gentner (1981). Participants read stories in which a character
      &#8216;thought&#8217; something was true. On a subsequent recall task, readers
      sometimes falsely recalled the verb &#8216;thought&#8217; as &#8216;knew,&#8217;
      implicitly indicating that the reader had attributed knowledge to the character.
      False recall of &#8216;knew&#8217; occurred more frequently when the story
      described a justified true belief than an unjustified belief. Justified true
      belief triggered these recall errors even in a so-called &#8220;Gettier
      case&#8221;. The present findings suggest that semantic integration provides an
      empirical paradigm suitable for investigating lay notions about knowledge. </p>
