	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent studies have shown that people use covariation information
      to infer causal structure. However, there is little information about how people
      derive causal directionality from covariation. The present study is designed to
      provide further evidence about the role of covariation in causal structure
      learning. In Experiment 1, where covariation between two variables was
      systematically manipulated, participants were asked to observe the states of
      bacteria (present or absent) and to infer their causal relationship. We found
      that judgments of causal structure varied as a function of covariation, and that
      participants interpreted covariation according to necessity of causation. In
      Experiment 2, participants who received information about high causal strength
      interpreted covariation according to sufficiency of causation. These results
      demonstrate that prior knowledge modulates interpretation of covariation and
      suggest that domain-general covariation information and domain-specific prior
      knowledge of causal relations interact in causal structure learning.</p>
