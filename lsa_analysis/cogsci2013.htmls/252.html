	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Screen media, such as television and videos, are a common part of
      young children&#8217;s lives. Yet infants and toddlers have been shown to learn
      less effectively from screens than from interactions with another person. Using a
      quasi-experimental design we explored how social factors of screen media
      co-viewing impact children&#8217;s learning outcomes. We observed parents
      co-viewing a novel word training video with their children, then tested children
      for immediate and delayed word learning. We then investigated the links between
      parental speech during co-viewing and children&#8217;s subsequent word learning.
      Parental speech that encouraged children to produce the novel words predicted
      better retention of word learning, whereas speech that focused more on the video
      itself rather than the content was negatively associated with learning.</p>
