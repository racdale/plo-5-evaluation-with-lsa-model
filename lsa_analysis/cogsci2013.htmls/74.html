	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Evaluating whether information is generalizable, essential
      knowledge about a novel category is a critical component of conceptual
      development. In previous work (Butler & Markman, 2012) 4-year-old children were
      able to use their understanding of whether information was explicitly
      communicated for their benefit to guide such reasoning, while 3-year-olds were
      not. In two experiments, we further investigate this finding. Four-year-olds were
      adept at navigating pedagogical interactions, judiciously identifying which
      specific actions in an ongoing interaction were meant as communicative
      demonstrations for their benefit, while 3-year-olds did not distinguish between
      the manners of demonstration even in a simpler context. Taken together, these
      experiments illustrate that this powerful learning mechanism for facilitating
      children&#8217;s conceptual development is under construction during the
      preschool years.</p>
