	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Models of risky choice have attracted much attention in
      behavioural economics. Previous research has repeatedly demonstrated that
      individuals' choices are not well explained by expected utility theory, and a
      number of alternative models have been examined using carefully selected sets of
      choice alternatives. The model performance however, can depend on which choice
      alternatives are being
      tested. Here we develop a non-parametric method for estimating the utility map
      over the wide range of choice alternatives. The estimated maps are compared
      against the three of the most well-known models of risky choice: expected utility
      theory, cumulative prospect theory, and the transfer of attention exchange model.
      Model comparison indicates that cumulative prospect theory provides a better
      prediction of individuals' choices, but the estimated maps show that the overall
      shape of utility map is different from what the model predicts.</p>
