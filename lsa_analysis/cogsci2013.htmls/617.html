	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Gender differences are not widely studied in the categorization
      literature and the studies that did focus on gender differences generally
      investigated processing differences or differences in the use of particular
      categorization answers (absolute versus  continuous). In the following study we
      looked at differences in the likelihood that men or women consider an item to be
      part of a category. The objective of the study was twofold: we wanted to
      introduce a model that is able to determine whether there are meaningful
      differences in categorization between groups and that is able to identify the
      sources of these differences. Secondly with this model we wanted to show that
      there were meaningful categorization differences between men and women: these
      differences are located at the level of the  representation and/or the criterion.
      </p>
