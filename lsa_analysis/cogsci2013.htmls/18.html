	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many computational- or rational-level models of cognition
      postulate computations that appear to be computationally intractable (e.g.,
      NP-hard or worse). Formally, this means that the postulated computations consume
      an exponential amount of time. Informally, this means that the postulated
      computations do not scale in any obvious way to explain how the modeled cognitive
      capacities can operate in the real world outside the lab. This problem of
      intractability is quite common in cognitive science. It is observed in
      practically all domains of cognition, including, for instance, perception,
      language, reasoning, categorization, decision-making, and motor planning. It is
      also not specific to any particular class of models, as it can arise for
      symbolic, connectionist, probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian), dynamical, logic-based,
      and even heuristic models of cognition.</p>
