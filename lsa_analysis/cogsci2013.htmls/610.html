	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study aims to replicate the irrelevant speech effect (ISE) in
      a local context and, more important, is the first to directly investigate if
      musical information can reduce impairments imposed by the ISE on a serial word
      recall task. Thirty-five undergraduates from the National University of Singapore
      performed serial recall on 10 word lists. The lists were presented under 5
      auditory conditions, namely: Music-Only, Combined (music with background speech),
      Scrambled music with background speech, Background Speech-Only and White Noise
      conditions. The Scrambled condition contained the same piece of music as the
      Combined condition except that it was re-arranged in a random fashion; the
      mission of this condition was to specifically provide a comparison basis to test
      if &#8220;musical structure&#8221; per se actually attenuates the ISE. A
      significant main effect of music conditions emerged. ISE was successfully
      replicated, where a significantly lower percentage of correct words was recalled
      in the Background Speech-Only condition compared to all other conditions. ISE was
      also successfully attenuated, but the present data suggest that musical structure
      per se was not (at least not entirely) responsible for the attenuation, since the
      Scrambled condition had superior performance than both the Combined and
      Background Speech-Only conditions.  Here, we propose and discuss several novel
      theoretical models involving changing acoustical features, selective attention,
      and arousal to account for the present findings.</p>
