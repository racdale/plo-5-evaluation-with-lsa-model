	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Twenty 3.5- to 4-year-olds participated in a study to investigate
      children&#8217;s understanding of the representative and communicative nature of
      iconic gestures. Two toys, one of them with a sticker attached, were presented to
      the child. It was not possible to request the toy with the sticker by asking
      (experimenter wore headphones) or pointing (toys were too close together), but
      they could show the experimenter which toy they wanted by performing the correct
      gesture. Children had to generate the correct iconic gestures themselves as the
      gestures were not modeled during test trials. On 70% of the trials children
      performed a correct gesture (p = .045), instead of only producing other response
      types (no response, verbal request, wrong gesture, pointing). This study shows
      that children understand that iconic gestures can represent objects, and also
      that they can use iconic gestures to communicate.</p>
