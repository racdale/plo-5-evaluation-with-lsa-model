	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Several behavioral studies have reported functional similarities
      between visuospatial imagery and visuospatial perception. For instance, in the
      classic image-scanning paradigm (Finke & Pinker, 1982) participants first inspect
      a dot pattern, which later disappears and is replaced by an arrow on a blank
      screen. The task is to judge whether the arrow points towards one of the previous
      dots. Results commonly show that the response time (RT) increases linearly with
      the distance between the arrow and the previous dot and has been taken as
      evidence for a structural equivalence between perception and imagery. Typically
      eye movements are prevented in this paradigm. 
      In the present study, eye movements were recorded for 23 participants in a free
      viewing version of the image-scanning paradigm. Results revealed that saccadic
      amplitudes increased linearly with the &#8220;imagined&#8221; scanning distance
      (p &lt; .001). But contrary to previous studies there was no significant effect
      between RT and scanning distance. </p>
