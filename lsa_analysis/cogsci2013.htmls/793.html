	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Dual-Process accounts claim that responses to reasoning tasks
      often default to automatically cued belief-based responses. However, recent
      findings show that when participants are instructed to evaluate the believability
      of a conclusion, its logical status interferes with their judgment. This finding
      is inconsistent with the view that belief based judgments are cued automatically.
      In this paper we present the results of three experiments that examined the
      impact of a secondary task (random number generation) on belief and validity
      judgments. Experiment 1 examined simple modus ponens arguments, experiment 2
      included disjunctive syllogisms and experiment three employed a blocked
      presentation design. 
      In line with previous research belief judgments took longer and resulted in more
      errors than validity judgments. However, in general, RNG impacted more on
      validity than belief based judgements.  These finding suggest that both belief
      and logic judgements require effortful processing but draw upon different types
      of executive resource.
