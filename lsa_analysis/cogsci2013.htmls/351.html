	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Analogical reasoning and its applications are gaining attention
      not only in cognitive science but also in the context of education and teaching.
      In this paper we provide a short analysis and a detailed formal model (based on
      the Heuristic-Driven Theory Projection framework for computational
      analogy-making) of the Calculation Circular Staircase, a tool for teaching basic
      arithmetic and insights based on the ordinal number conception of the natural
      numbers to children in their first years of primary school. We argue that such
      formal methods and computational accounts of analogy-making can be used to gain
      additional insights in the inner workings of analogy-based educational methods
      and tools.</p>
