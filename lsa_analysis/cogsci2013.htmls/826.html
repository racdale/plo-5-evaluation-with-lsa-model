	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The effect of language on category learning is an ongoing debate
      among researchers. According to previous research words can facilitate category
      formation even if they aren&#8217;t used as feedback. However in most research
      investigating language influence on category learning, the varying of verbal
      labels often correlates with varying of perceptual features. Such confound
      doesn&#8217;t allow to clarify if the language is a means of perception
      augmentation (language-feedback hypothesis) or a social marker for generalization
      (word-meaning-as-intention hypothesis). In the present experiment we separated
      the process of category learning from the label receiving. Two groups of subjects
      performed visual search task either with or without labels. Right after that task
      subjects had to form a category on the basis of new perceptual information added
      to the old one. As a result subjects from label condition form a category but
      subjects from the no-label condition didn&#8217;t. The given data agree with
      word-meaning-as-intention hypothesis.</p>
