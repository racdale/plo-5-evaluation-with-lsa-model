	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Judging whether multiple events will co-occur is an important
      aspect of everyday decision making; however, the underlying probabilities of
      occurrence are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experience. Using a
      rigorous, quantitative model comparison, we investigate how people judge the
      probabilities of multiple events to co-occur. In a computerized experiment,
      participants had to repeatedly choose between two pairs of conjunctive events
      (represented as two gambles). Participants had access to a small sample of
      information to estimate the probability that both events occur. A hierarchical
      Bayesian approach used for estimating the models&#8217; parameters and for
      testing the models against each other showed that the plurality of participants
      were best described by the configural weighted average model. This model assumes
      that constituent probabilities are ranked by importance, weighted accordingly,
      and added up. The cognitive modeling approach provides an understanding of the
      cognitive processes underlying people's conjunctive probability judgments.</p>
