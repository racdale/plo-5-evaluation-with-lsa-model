	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recognition  of  motion  is  vitally  important  to  any  animal. 
      Vision  research  has  proposed  a  number  of  algorithms applicable to action
      recognition. However, unlike successes in early  visual  perception,  the  past 
      studies  have  not  yet established the computational theory of action
      recognition. In the present study, we employ a dynamical systems approach and 
      hypothesize  that  motions  are  encoded  cognitively  as  a topological
      structure abstracted from physical particulars. We investigated  whether  a 
      common  topological  nature  could  be found  in  a  type  of  rhythmic 
      movement.  The  topological nature of action dynamics showed a striking
      similarity, which could  not  have  been  identified  with  other  analyses 
      where physical properties were retained. The result suggests that the dynamical 
      perspective  serves  as  a  theoretical  basis  in studying complex human
      movements. </p>
