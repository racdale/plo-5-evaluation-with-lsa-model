	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Language can be viewed as a set of cues that subtly modulate the
      comprehender&#8217;s thought processes. For example, the literature suggests that
      people perceive direct speech  as more vivid and perceptually engaging than
      indirect speech. We sought to address how this alleged vividness is evident in
      comprehenders&#8217; mental representations in a series of experiments. Our
      results do not support the idea that, compared to indirect speech, direct speech
      enhances the accessibility of information from the communicative or referential
      situation during comprehension. Neither do our results support the idea that the
      hypothesized more vivid experience of direct speech is caused by switching from
      the visual to the auditory modality. However, our results do show that direct
      speech leads to a stronger mental representation of the exact wording of a
      sentence than does indirect speech. These results show that language has a more
      subtle influence on memory representations than was previously suggested. </p>
