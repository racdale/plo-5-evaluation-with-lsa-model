	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the temporal dynamics of response choice in a
      decision-making task by examining the evolving implicit responses indicated by
      hand movements made before an explicit response is selected. Participants (N=31)
      judged which of two cars would go faster when the underlying rule was plausible
      or implausible and when two response choices differed with respect to one or two
      causal variables. Participants completed 300 trials in five blocks. We found an
      interaction between trial type, block, and plausibility of rule. In earlier
      trials in the implausible rule condition, there was greater deviation towards the
      distracter response before selecting the correct response. Participants given
      implausible rules demonstrated less activation of competing representations over
      time as they induced the underlying rules, particularly on trials in which
      response choices differed on both causal variables. Mouse trajectories did not
      change across blocks for participants given the plausible rule, suggesting they
      learned the rule early.</p>
