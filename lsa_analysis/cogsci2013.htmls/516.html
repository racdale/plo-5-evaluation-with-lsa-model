	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The purpose of the current work is to examine when and how
      knowing collective opinion influences people&#8217;s judgments
      and decisions in social media environments. In particular, the
      present work focuses on people&#8217;s true-false judgment of
      statements found on websites and the likelihood of sharing
      these statements. The results from Experiment 1 revealed that,
      for false statements, collective opinion had little influence on
      people&#8217;s true-false judgments, but, for true and debatable
      statements, their judgments were biased toward collective
      opinion. The results from Experiment 2 indicated that the
      likelihood of sharing the true, debatable, and false statements
      followed the collective opinion, and that people were less
      likely to share false statements than debatable or true ones
      without collective opinion. These findings extend past work
      on social influence and advance understanding of how people
      make judgments and decisions in social media websites.</p>
