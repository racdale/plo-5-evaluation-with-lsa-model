	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>While recent studies show dissociation between the implicit and
      explicit aspects of &#8216;sense of agency&#8217;, the mechanisms underlying
      these different aspects of agency are not yet clearly understood. We argue that
      the control achieved at different levels of hierarchy is important for different
      aspects of agency. In the current study, we investigate how changes in control at
      the perceptual-motor level and at goal level influence implicit and explicit
      measures of sense of agency. In a given trial, participants were first required
      to aim at a target in a noisy environment and then shoot at the target. After
      certain interval, a circle flashed at the location where participant aimed while
      pressing the trigger. Participants estimated the interval between action and
      presentation of the circle that acted as a measure of intentional binding, an
      implicit measure of agency and also rated an explicit sense of authorship. The
      results suggest that different aspects of agency and dissociation between
      implicit and explicit aspects of agency are mediated by control achieved at
      various levels.</p>
