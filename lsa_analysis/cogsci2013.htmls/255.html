	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In order to interact with the world, people must be able to
      predict how it will unfold in the future, and these predictions must be updated
      regularly in light of new information. Here we study how the mind updates these
      predictions over time. Participants were asked to make ongoing predictions about
      the destination of a simulated ball moving on a 2D bumper table. We modeled these
      decisions by assuming people simulate the world forward under uncertainty. This
      model fit participants&#8217; behavior well overall, suggesting that people
      continuously update their physical simulations to inform their decisions. In some
      specific scenarios participants&#8217; behavior is not fit well by the simulation
      based model in a manner suggesting that in certain cases people may be using
      qualitative, rather than simulation-based, physical reasoning.</p>
