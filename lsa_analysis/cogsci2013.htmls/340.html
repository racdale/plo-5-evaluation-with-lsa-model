	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Related languages, like English and Spanish, often have similar
      orthographies but use the same letters for different sounds. Learning a second
      language frequently involves learning additional letter-sound mappings that
      mismatch native language mappings. In the current study, we investigated whether
      L2 spoken words activate L2 orthography despite conflict with L1
      orthography-to-phonology mappings. Participants first learned an artificial
      language with letter-sound mappings that mismatched English (e.g., the letter 'G'
      represented /h/, and the word /gufo/ was spelled 'hane'). Next, fixations of L1
      orthographic competitors (e.g., 'cane') in response to auditory L2 input (e.g.,
      /gufo/) were assessed using the visual world paradigm. Results showed that
      participants fixated L1 competitors that overlapped with targets orthographically
      (but not phonologically) more than unrelated fillers. We conclude that second
      language learners can rapidly acquire novel letter-sound mappings, and words
      based on these mappings are integrated into the existing lexicon, activating
      orthographic competitors in the native language.</p>
