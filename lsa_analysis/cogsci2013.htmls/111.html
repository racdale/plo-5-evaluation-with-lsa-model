	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When referring to an object using a description, speakers need to
      select properties which jointly distinguish it from any potential distractors.
      Previous empirical and computational work addressing this content selection
      process has highlighted the role of both (i) the discriminatory power of
      properties of a referent, i.e. how many of the distractors in a domain each
      property excludes; (ii) how inherently salient or preferred a property is. To
      date, there has been no attempt to systematically investigate the trade-o
      between these two potentially competing motivations. This paper investigates
      experimentally the extent to which speakers take discriminatory power versus
      preference into account during content selection for reference production. Our
      results suggest that discriminatory power in fact plays a relatively unimportant
      role. We discuss the implications of this for computational models of reference
      production.</p>
