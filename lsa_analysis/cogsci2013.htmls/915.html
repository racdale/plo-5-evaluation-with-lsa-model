	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Search requires individuals to balance exploration (finding new
      resources) with exploitation (making use of current resources) over time. How
      individuals perceive reward in a temporally extended search may significantly
      influence their explore/exploit decisions. Furthermore, how individuals perceive
      reward is related to impulsivity. Different aspects of impulsivity can lead to
      different predictions for people's search patterns. We tested some of these
      predictions in a search task with a non-depleting condition where resources would
      maintain value when exploited, and a depleting condition where resources lost
      value when exploited.  Participants with larger temporal discounting rates
      (greater impulsivity) started exploiting depleting resources later than those
      with smaller discount rates, surprisingly appearing more patient and performing
      closer to the optimal level. However, this difference disappeared when resources
      were non-depleting. Greater impulsivity might make individuals more risk-seeking
      in the depleting search environment and thus explore depleting resources longer
      at the beginning phase of the search task.</p>
