	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Mimicry and imitation are crucial mechanisms of social learning
      and rapport.  Further, mimicry informs essential social judgments formed not only
      by the interacting party but also by third-party observers.  How sophisticated
      are observer&#8217;s inferences from mimicry?  We examined this in the context of
      observers&#8217; use of mimicry to judge trustworthiness.  Participants observed
      a dyadic interaction in which a target mimicked or did not mimic a model.  Prior
      to observation, the model&#8217;s honesty was earlier defamed, or praised, in
      front of some, but not other, targets. Observers always knew the model&#8217;s
      reputation. Observers also knew which targets were aware of the model&#8217;s
      reputation.  Results suggest that observers&#8217; use of mimicry in trust
      judgments is very sophisticated It reflects not just the presence of mimicry, but
      also the model&#8217;s moral reputation and, critically, knowledge of the
      target&#8217;s awareness of the model&#8217;s reputation.  This sophistication
      leads observers to rate targets as trustworthy when they mimic untrustworthy
      models, but only when the observers know that the model reputation is unknown to
      the target.</p>
