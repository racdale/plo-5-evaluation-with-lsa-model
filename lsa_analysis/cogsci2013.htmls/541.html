	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Theory of mind (ToM) is required when reasoning about mental
      states such as knowledge, beliefs, desires, and intentions. Many complex
      reasoning tasks require domain-general cognitive resources such as planning,
      resistance to interference, and working memory. In this paper we present a study
      of the additional cognitive costs of reasoning about mental states. We presented
      participants with sequential games in which they have to reason about another
      player. In the so-called player condition, the other player is reasoning about
      the participant, whereas in the so-called balance condition, the other player is
      reasoning about a balance scale. Both types of games require the same
      comparisons, but only differ in the required depth of ToM reasoning. Games in the
      player condition require one additional switch between perspectives. The results
      show that participants make different types of mistakes in the player condition
      as compared to the balance condition. This finding implies a different reasoning
      process when reasoning about mental states. The results also show faster
      decreasing reaction times in the balance condition than in the player condition.
      Based on these findings, we argue that reasoning about mental states requires
      unique cognitive resources.</p>
