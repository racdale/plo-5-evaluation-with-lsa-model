	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>People have a strong confirmatory bias, which is remarkably
      difficult to overcome. In this research, we investigated how we could help people
      rectify the confirmatory bias, using Wason(1960)&#8217;s 2-4-6 task. 195
      University and middle school students participated in our study, in which they
      were to find out the rule &#8220;increasing 3 numbers,&#8221; starting from the
      2-4-6 number sequence. Prior to the task, the participants were assigned to one
      of the four training conditions: (1)&#8220;Counter-Examples&#8221;, in which
      participants were instructed to create the positive and counter-examples for the
      current hypothesis; (2) &#8220;Two-Hypotheses&#8221;, in which participants were
      instructed to create examples for two different hypotheses; (3)
      &#8220;Counter-Examples-AND-Two-Hypotheses; (4) Control, in which participants
      were told to think about examples consistent with their hypothesis. We found that
      the training to think counter-examples facilitates attempts to falsify the
      current hypothesis and subsequent hypothesis change, but creating examples for
      two different hypothesis did not.</p>
