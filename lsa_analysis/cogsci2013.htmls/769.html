	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The relationship between language and space has been intensely
      investigated. The underlying question has been whether one affects the other,
      usually within the scope of spatial language. Largely ignored is the possible
      role of bilingualism. Given that the average person speaks more than one
      language, and the mounting evidence showing that bilingualism interacts with
      non-linguistic processes (e.g., Bialystok & Senman, 2004), we investigated what
      effect bilingualism would have on non-linguistic spatial processing.

      We tested 120 participants with a range of linguistic abilities using four
      classic spatial tasks, e.g. mental rotation. We found patterns of systematic
      interaction between bilingualism and spatial processing. These findings raise
      questions beyond the relationship between spatial language and spatial cognition,
      suggesting that language as a cognitive process may share a common neural
      substrate with space. </p>
