	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Since the original experiments on choice blindness for faces
      (Johansson et al 2005), many studies have extended the phenomenon to other
      domains but few have focused on attaining a deeper understanding of the
      phenomenon itself. We here report on an experiment which closely follows the
      original study (albeit in computerized form and with a Singaporean population),
      with additional elements aimed at explicating the causal structure and temporal
      dynamics of the underlying processes.

      Contrary to intuition, we find that subjects who notice and immediately report a
      &#8220;manipulation&#8221; trial still miss about half of subsequent manipulation
      trials. Detection is also found to be highly sensitive to the form and timing of
      the opportunities to report. We also investigate the effects of choice
      manipulation on attractiveness ratings, finding that manipulations do modulate
      subsequent attractiveness ratings but that this effect falls below significance
      after a 2-week interval.
