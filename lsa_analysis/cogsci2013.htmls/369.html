	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper examines whether producing gestures would facilitate
      encoding of spatial relation in a navigation task. In this experiment, we focused
      on gestures produced without accompanying speech. Adult participants were asked
      to study spatial sequence of routes shown in four diagrams, one at a time.
      Participants rehearsed the routes with gestures, actual hand movements (actually
      drew the routes on papers), or mental simulation. They then were asked to
      reconstruct the routes with sticks. Participants who moved their hands (either in
      the form of gestures or actual drawing) recalled better than those who mentally
      simulated the routes and those who did not rehearse, suggesting that hand
      movements produced during rehearsal facilitate encoding of spatial relation.
      Interestingly, participants who gestured the routes in the air recalled better
      than those who drew them on papers, suggesting that gesture, as a kind of
      representational action, exerts more powerful influence on spatial relation
      encoding.</p>
