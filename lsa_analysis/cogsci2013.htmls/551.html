	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>People's estimations of how certain speakers are of their
      knowledge (FOAK) match speakers' own estimation (FOK) of how certain they are
      (Brennan & Williams, 1995). This is because others can interpret the verbal and
      nonverbal cues of (un)certainty that a speaker displays (Brennan & Williams,
      1995; Swerts & Krahmer, 2005). Estimating another's certainty thus seems to be
      driven by the bottom-up processing of speaker-displayed cues. In this paper, we
      explore the top-down influence of beliefs about a speaker on judgments of a
      speaker's certainty. In a perception study, we varied whether a speaker's
      proclaimed profession would make him an expert or a novice on the topic he was
      questioned on. Such beliefs were shown to influence participants' ratings of the
      speaker's certainty, in addition to speaker-displayed cues. Thus, next to the
      bottom-up processing of speaker-displayed cues, the top-down processing of
      beliefs about a speaker influences judgments of others' certainty.</p>
