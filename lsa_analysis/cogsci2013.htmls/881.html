	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The distractor-response binding effect states (Frings, Rothermund,
      & Wentura, 2007) that distractors appearing on a prime display create an
      association with the response given. This association is retrieved when, in the
      probe, the distractor is repeated; the retrieved response can be compatible or
      incompatible to the currently demanded probe response thereby influencing
      behavior. We tested if the distractor-response binding effect also occurs in
      decision making processes under uncertainty (N = 31). Participants had to decide
      whether two consecutive, imagined patients suffered from either of two diseases.
      Each decision was based on two cues; one did not discriminate between the two
      diseases and the other was either strongly or mildly associated with one of the
      two diseases. The repeating of the irrelevant cue influences decision
      significantly. Furthermore, we replicated these findings when we varied the
      strength of the discriminating cue as between-subject factor. </p>
