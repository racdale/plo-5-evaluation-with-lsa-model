	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A new method is demonstrated for identifying processing stages in
      a task. Since the 1860s cognitive scientists have used different methods to
      identify processing stages, usually based on reaction time (RT) differences
      between conditions. To overcome the limitations of RT-based methods we used
      Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to analyze EEG data. The HMMs indicate for how many
      stages there is evidence in the data, and how the durations of these stages vary
      with experimental condition. This method was applied to an associative
      recognition task in which associative strength and target/foil type were
      manipulated. The HMM-EEG method identified six different processing stages for
      targets and re-paired foils, whereas four similar stages were identified for new
      foils. The duration of the third, fifth and sixth stage varied with associative
      strength for targets and re-paired foils. We present an interpretation of the
      identified stages, and conclude that the method can provide valuable insight in
      human information processing.</p>
