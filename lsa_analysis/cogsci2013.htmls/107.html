	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>  The analysis of the internal structure of concepts reveals the
        presence of a substantial amount of contextual information. Even
        though this interaction is easily recognizable, it is not clear how
        contextual information is processed and included into concept
        representations.  The aim of this paper is to shed light on this
        question by analyzing the effect that an increasing amount of
        context exerts on conceptual processing. We report a self-paced
        reading experiment and a visual world experiment to test two
        hypotheses about the integration of context information: the
        incremental activation hypothesis suggests that the degree of
        facilitation in concept processing increases with the amount of
        context available; and the immediate activation hypothesis
        states that once a sufficient amount of contextual support is
        reached, no more facilitation occurs. Our data are compatible with
        the latter account.</p>
