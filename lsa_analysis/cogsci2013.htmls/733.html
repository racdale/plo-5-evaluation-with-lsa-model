	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cultural Variation in Families&#8217; Shared Engagement
       
           This study examines whether Indigenous-heritage Mayan mothers and their
      young children are more likely than middle-class European American mothers and
      their children to engage by blending agendas in fluid collaboration while
      exploring novel objects together.  Fluid collaboration appears to be encouraged
      in many Indigenous communities of the Americas, where children often collaborate
      in ongoing family and community endeavors (Rogoff, 2003; Mozier & Rogoff, 1993,
      2003).  The present research submits audio signals of videotaped observations of
      mothers and their children in home interactions to micro-analysis using
      spectrographs, to compare the interactions of Mayan and European American
      families (Gratier,  2003, 2013; Malloch, 1999; Trevarthen, 2008).  In the visual
      representations of their vocalizations, we find evidence that the Mayan families
      more frequently use smooth collaboration whereas the middle-class European
      American families appear to struggle more to establish a shared rhythm in their
      interactions.
