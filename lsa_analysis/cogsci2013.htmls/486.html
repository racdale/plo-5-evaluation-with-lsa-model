	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We describe two studies that show that when individuals who are
      not programmers create algorithms, they rely on mental simulations. Our studies
      concerned a railway domain in which carriages are rearranged &#8211; a simple
      environment but equivalent in computational power to a Turing machine.
      Participants successfully solved rearrangement problems (Experiment 1), and
      created algorithms to solve them (Experiment 2) and their performance
      corroborated the use of simulation. The participants tended to use loops and to
      prefer while-loops even though they are of greater computational power than
      for-loops. Their ability to create algorithms for abstract problems improved when
      they first had to create algorithms for more concrete problems. We devised a
      computer program that creates its own algorithms for rearrangement problems. It
      generates Lisp functions that operate on lists and creates descriptions of them
      in everyday language. The complexity of the resulting algorithms predicts
      participants&#8217; difficulty in devising them.</p>
