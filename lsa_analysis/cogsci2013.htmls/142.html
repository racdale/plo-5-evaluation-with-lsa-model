	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The first two years of life are characterized by considerable
      change in all domains &#8211; perception, cognition, action, and social
      interactions.  Here, we consider the statistical structure of visual input during
      these two years. Infants spanning the ages from 1 to 24 months wore body-mounted
      video cameras for 6 hours at home as they engaged in their daily activities. Our
      data strongly suggest that the statistical structure of the learning environment
      is dynamic and ordered. The available visual statistics are not stationary, but
      rather they are gated by young children's developmental level. We find a rolling
      wave of "See-Saw" patterns over developmental time in two classes of important
      social stimuli: First faces, then hands; and within hands, first
      other-then-self-then-touching-then-holding. These ordered environments may help
      learning systems &#8220;start small,&#8221; find the optimal path to the optimal
      solution, and determine the architecture of the system that does the
      learning.</p>
