	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The sensory consequences of intentional actions are perceived to
      be attenuated compared to equivalent but externally generated stimuli. It is
      thought that forward models in the sensorimotor system partially cancel
      predictable reafferent sensory feedback in order to bias attention towards more
      novel or unexpected stimuli. But does merely observing familiar actions also
      trigger forward models with attendant sensory attenuation? Previous studies
      investigated this question in the auditory modality with conflicting results. We
      conducted two attenuation experiments in a visual modality to conceptually
      replicate and generalize previous findings (Exp 1), and to control for
      differences in temporal predictability and attention which may have confounded
      previous studies (Exp 2).

      We found that movements initiated by humans (self or other) were attenuated
      compared to computer movements, and self-initiated movements were the most
      attenuated. Adding Go signals prior to movements counteracted attenuation.
      Perceived speed is thus influenced by agency as well as attention.</p>
