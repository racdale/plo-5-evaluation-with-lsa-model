	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of the reported study was to test the hypothesis that
      text-picture combinations aid learning because pictures reduce the
      learners&#8217; need to actively generate mental images on their own. This, in
      turn, should free up cognitive resources which can be used for other cognitive
      processes associated with learning, resulting in better performance compared to a
      text-only condition. This hypothesis was confirmed in an experiment based on a
      2x2 design with picture presentation prior to text (yes vs. no) and visuo-spatial
      secondary task (with vs. without) as independent variables: Learners without
      pictures showed a higher load of the visuo-spatial sketchpad (i.e., higher
      interference with the secondary task) during text processing than learners with
      pictures, presumably because the former generated mental images during reading.
      This interpretation is supported by the finding that pictures were especially
      helpful for learners with low imagery capacity. The implications of these results
      are discussed.</p>
