	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We applied the mouse-tracking methodology to a phonological cohort
      task interpretable as a version of the A-not-B task. In the first experiment,
      participants had to click a word like &#8220;candle&#8221; repeatedly on the same
      side of the computer screen. They then had to click a phonological competitor
      (&#8220;candy&#8221;) on the other side. This was contrasted with a condition in
      which the word to be clicked repeatedly on the same side was phonologically
      unrelated to the word at the critical trial. We found that the phonological
      priming increased attraction toward the competitor. In the second experiment,
      mouse movements revealed attraction towards the competitor as a function of the
      number of previous presentations. The results demonstrate that phonological
      competitors can exert influence on responses even if the competitors are not
      simultaneously presented. These results are predicted by and provide evidence for
      the dynamic field theory of movement preparation and execution. </p>
