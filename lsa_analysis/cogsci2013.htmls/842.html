	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Intention understanding is necessary during the formation of human
      communication system. Though the linkage between mirror system and intention
      understanding has been examined by many studies, the evidence of activities of
      mirror system during the formation of human symbolic communication system, in
      which no explicit demonstration of actions is involved, are still limited.

      We recorded the neural activities with electroencephalography during a
      coordination game with message passing, which involves formation of symbolic
      communication system. In this experiment, two subjects were separated into two
      rooms, thus they could not see any movement of communication partners or hear any
      sound from the partners&#8217; actions. Significant mu rhythm suppression is
      found over sensorimotor cortex both when the subjects send and receive messages.

      This preliminary result indicates that intention understanding involved in
      message interpretation can also induce the activities of mirror system, even
      without explicit referring to actions.</p>
