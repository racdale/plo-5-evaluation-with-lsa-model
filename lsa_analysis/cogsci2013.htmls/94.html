	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We test the hypothesis that superficial knowledge interdependence
      is more effective in fostering individual learning from collaboration than the
      true knowledge interdependence often realized by jigsaw-type collaboration
      arrangements. Based on research on group information-processing, we argue for the
      benefits of distributing only contextual information, but not core principles
      between learners, establishing superficial knowledge interdependence. In a
      computer-supported collaborative learning environment, 78 university students
      learned about stochastic urn models. Knowledge interdependence was established by
      systematically distributing learning materials within student triads, so that
      students either became experts for an urn model, establishing true knowledge
      interdependence, or for one of the embedding cover stories, establishing
      superficial knowledge interdependence. Afterwards, all triads worked on the same
      collaborative tasks, and were exposed to all models. Results show successful
      learning across conditions, but superior knowledge transfer in triads
      collaborating under superficial knowledge interdependence. Benefits were highest
      for low prior knowledge learners.</p>
