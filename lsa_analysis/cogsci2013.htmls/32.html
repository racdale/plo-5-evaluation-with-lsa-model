	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Narrative, a distinctly cognitive phenomenon, has long been of
      interest to
      the disciplines that comprise cognitive science.  The past decade has seen a
      resurgence of work using computational methods to understand, manipulate,
      generate, and leverage narratives. This symposium, which is held in association
      with the Fourth International Workshop on Computational Models of Narrative
      (CMN'13), a satellite event of CogSci 2013, will focus on aspects of the
      scientific and computational understanding of narrative that intersect with
      cognitive science.  The speakers and moderators are drawn from diverse fields
      including cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, cognitive science,
      computational linguistics, and the humanities, and they will focus on a variety
      of topics including: narrative and its role in analogy, education, and
      persuasion; challenges in the representation of syntax, discourse, and semantics
      of narrative; psychological and neuropsychological aspects of
      narrative; and the growing integration of computational models of narrative in
      humanities research.</p>
