	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Language abilities gradually decline as we age, but the mechanisms
      of this decline are not well understood. The present study investigated
      comprehension of subject vs. object who and which direct questions (DQs),
      embedded questions (EQs) and relative clauses (RCs) in 39 cognitively healthy
      native speakers of Spanish. The elderly participants (n = 21) were further
      classified according to their scores on a general cognitive test, Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), into a group with low MoCA scores, LM (n = 10), and
      a group with normal MoCA scores, NM (n = 11). A mixed-model, repeated-measures
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the elderly participants achieved
      significantly worse accuracy and speed than the young participants (Y) in all
      tasks. Accuracy was significantly lower and reaction times significantly longer
      in the LM group compared to the NM group in DQs and RCs. Accuracy in
      comprehension of EQs was also worse in LM compared to NM, with no significant
      difference in RTs between the two groups. The results are explained within the
      competition model and reliance on a language-specific cueing strategy. Reliance
      on cueing strategies in sentence comprehension may be an effective indicator of
      cognitive decline associated with aging.</p>
