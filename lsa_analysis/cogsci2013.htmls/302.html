	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Most predictions can be partitioned into two components: the
      predicted outcome, and the chance that one considers the outcome will happen. We
      studied how people evaluate predictions with binary outcomes. These predictions
      can be conveyed in two equivalent ways: one predicting an outcome with some
      probability, and the other predicting the other outcome with the probability of
      the complement of the first outcome. Although these two ways of stating the
      predictions are mathematically interchangeable, we hypothesized that people would
      judge the congruently stated prediction, one that has the same qualitative
      component as the actual outcome, as more accurate. We tested this hypothesis in
      four experiments. Results suggested that this effect is consistent across a
      number of domains; depends on the frame in which the prediction is stated; is
      robust regardless of whether the ratings were elicited in positive or negative
      terms; holds for both rating and choice tasks.</p>
