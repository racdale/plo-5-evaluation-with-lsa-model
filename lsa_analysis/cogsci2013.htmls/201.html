	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Humans can perform several different tasks on the same set of
      stimuli in rapid alternation.  Each task, signaled by a distinct task cue, may
      require the classification of stimuli using a different stimulus attribute.
      However, such "task switching" performance comes at a cost, as expressed by
      weaker performance when switching rather than repeating tasks. This cost is often
      claimed to be the consequence of a mental reorientation away from the previous
      task and towards the new task, requiring executive control of behavior.
      Alternatively, task switching could simply be based on the retrieval of different
      cue-stimulus-response associations. In this experiment, pigeons learned
      go-left/go-right discriminations between grating patterns according to either
      their spatial frequency or their orientation, depending on the color of the
      pattern (the task cue). When humans solved the same tasks on the basis of
      verbalizable rules, they responded more slowly and made more errors on trials
      where they had to switch between tasks than when repeating the same task. Pigeons
      did not show this "switch cost"; but like humans, their performance was
      significantly worse when the response (left or right) to a given stimulus varied
      between tasks than when it stayed the same (the &#8220;congruency effect&#8221;).
      Larger effects of both switch costs and congruency were observed in humans
      learning the tasks by trial and error. We discuss the potential driving factors
      behind these very different patterns of performance for both humans and
      pigeons.</p>
