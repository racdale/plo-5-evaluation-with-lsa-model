	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Verbal analogies produced during naturally occurring instructional
      discourse in mathematics were explored using techniques borrowed from studies of
      language in use (see Wortham & Rymes, 2003). Close examination of two
      eighth-grade instructional analogies reveals that the language practices of
      analogy are instrumental in shaping recipients&#8217; relational
      re-representation of objects being compared, in particular through markers of
      indexicality and poetic parallel structure. At the same time, close examination
      of the communicative interactions reveals that these devices may reduce the
      burden on recipients&#8217; reasoning to the point that they may appear
      successful at solving the verbal analogy, but their responses can be explained by
      facility in verbal interaction rather than in mathematical reasoning. These data
      provide thereby new insights into the &#8220;analogical paradox,&#8221; the
      finding that analogies are commonly successful as vehicles for interactionally
      producing and displaying understanding of new information in everyday contexts
      but generally problematic when measured for their effects on reasoning in
      controlled laboratory settings (Dunbar, 1998). We identify a tension between
      interactional and cognitive success of everyday communicative analogies, meaning
      that those that are most likely to be interactionally successful may lead to less
      cognitive engagement for analogy recipients.</p>
