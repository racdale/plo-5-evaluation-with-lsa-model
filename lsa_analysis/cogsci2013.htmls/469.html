	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Concept-location facilitation effects for words presented in
      isolation have been cited as evidence for embodied cognition. Prior work has
      demonstrated that words found in high physical locations (e.g., bird) are
      processed faster at the top of the screen and words found in low physical
      locations (e.g., fish) are processed faster at the bottom of the screen. In a
      response time experiment we presented participants with physical-location words
      from existing studies at the top or bottom, top or center, and center or bottom
      of the screen. We did this in order to determine if word judgments were made with
      respect to an absolute location on the screen (embodied explanation) or with
      respect to a relative location in comparison to other words included in the
      experimental session (statistical linguistic explanation). For animate words we
      found a concept location facilitation effect for words presented at the top of
      the screen, at the center of the screen, and at the bottom of the screen. In
      addition, bigram frequencies explained RTs to center words. Findings indicated
      that subjects made judgments relative to other words on the screen and not
      relative to their absolute location on the screen, lending support to a
      statistical linguistic explanation of the findings.</p>
