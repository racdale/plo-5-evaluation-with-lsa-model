	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Dual-process models of categorization posit dissociable implicit
      and explicit category learning systems. Evidence in favour of these accounts is
      typically obtained by examining how categorization responses differ over time,
      with differing category structures, and by changing task demands. If these two
      categorization systems are activated concurrently (e.g., COVIS) then both
      implicit and explicit representations can be examined over the course of learning
      even when one system dominates category response selection. In the current study,
      we used subjective measures of performance (i.e., confidence reports) to
      continuously sample from a participant&#8217;s explicit representation of the
      category structure while also examining changes in these reports over the course
      of training. Using category structures that motivate the acquisition of either
      explicit or implicit representations, we observed differences in confidence
      reports that did not correspond to changes in categorization accuracy. These
      findings provide evidence for categorization systems that contain different
      representations.</p>
