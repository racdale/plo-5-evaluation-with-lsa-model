	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent research suggests that children&#8217;s ability to learn
      words via fast mapping is strongly related to the attentional demands of the
      task. Here we explore whether lowering the attentional demands during the initial
      fast mapping task facilitates word learning. Three-year-old children completed
      fast mapping and test trials using a touch screen computer. For half of the
      children, the non-targets (competitors) repeated across trials and for other
      children there was no repetition. All children received the same word learning
      test trials. Only children who had received repeating competitors (lower
      attentional demands) during the initial fast mapping task demonstrated word
      learning. Thus, these data suggest that children&#8217;s ability to learn novel
      names is strongly influenced by the competition and attentional demands of the
      initial fast mapping context.</p>
