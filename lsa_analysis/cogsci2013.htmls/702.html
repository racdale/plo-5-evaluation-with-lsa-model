	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent work in experimental semiotics has started to investigate
      the cognitive processes supporting the emergence of human communicative systems.
      We present a computational model of the cognitive processes involved in
      establishing a novel referential communicative system, as operationalized with
      the Tacit Communication Game (TCG). This experimental paradigm has been used to
      study the socio-cognitive underpinnings of human communication. We model how
      players of the TCG can successfully generate and understand communicative
      behavior in a novel, visuospatial domain using Structure Mapping Theory (SMT).

      Many of the processes necessary to communicate in this game are forms of
      analogical reasoning that are captured by SMT (e.g. abstraction and analogical
      transfer). Yet, we also identify cognitive processes&#8212;not yet formalized
      under SMT&#8212;that are necessary for the genesis of new communicative systems.
      This is an important first step in formally characterizing this creative
      socio-cognitive ability.</p>
