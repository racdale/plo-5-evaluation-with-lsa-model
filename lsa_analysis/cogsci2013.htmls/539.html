	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper presents a reaction time (RT) experiment that follows
      on from the work of Perruchet, Cleeremans, and Destrebeceqz (2006), investigating
      the extent to which reaction times (RTs) are governed by the conscious expectancy
      of a particular response. In this experiment, participants were presented with a
      single stimulus (which we will call the conditioned stimulus; CS) followed by one
      of two outcomes (which we will call unconditioned stimuli; USs); to which
      participants had to make an appropriate instrumental response. On every trial we
      recorded the time taken to make this response and participants were asked to rate
      their expectancy that one of the USs (US1) was going to occur. We found that the
      expectancy rating for US1 correlated negatively with RT on US1 trials. Over
      successive runs of reinforcement, when participants rated US1 as less likely to
      occur they were slower to respond to US1 (lower ratings, higher RTs). When we
      calculated the expectancy for US2 as the complement of that for US1 expectancy,
      expectancy of US2 correlated positively with RTs. Thus, across runs of
      reinforcement, participants responded more quickly to US2 when considering US2
      less likely (low rating, low RT). We argue that the requirement to make a
      conscious expectancy rating results in participants attending more to US1
      occurrences than those of US2. This results in a qualitatively different
      relationship between conscious expectancy and automatic responses that cannot be
      reconciled by a single processing system account. A dual processing system
      explanation of learning is proposed to explain these results. In support of this
      position, we successfully modeled our US2 RT data using a modified version of the
      Augmented simple recurrent network (Yeates, Jones, Wills, McLaren, & McLaren,
      2013).</p>
