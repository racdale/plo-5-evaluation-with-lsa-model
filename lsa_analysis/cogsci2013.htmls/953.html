	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Origami paper folding involves challenging spatial problem
      solving, including a number of complex cognitive processes that have not been
      extensively explored. To gain insights into the nature of these processes, we had
      participants think aloud while following Origami instructions (verbal and
      pictorial). Our analysis of participants&#8217; verbalizations revealed recurring
      patterns that reflect the underlying cognitive processes. Namely it showed
      evidence of reading and reformulating the task description, considering actions
      and task status, comparing task status to instructional pictures, evaluating
      progress, referring to previous experience, recognizing problems, and adding
      ideas about the current instructional step. The last two categories highlight how
      participants conceptualized this spatial task. The verbalizations also reflect a
      typical order that the cognitive processes follow: reading &#8211; reformulating
      &#8211; reconceptualizing &#8211; evaluating. The recurring pattern in this
      ordering suggests that participants gradually moved away from the original
      instruction towards a broader conceptualization for action in the current
      context.</p>
