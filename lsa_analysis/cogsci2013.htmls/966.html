	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Bilinguals have been shown to activate their two languages
      simultaneously during spoken word recognition (e.g., Blumenfeld & Marian, 2007).
      We investigated whether top-down conceptual processing influences parallel
      language activation using the visual world eye-tracking paradigm. Cultural
      knowledge was used to manipulate semantic activation in L1 during L2 word
      processing. Critical trials contained target items that were culturally
      meaningful to individuals who grew up in Germany, alongside German competitor
      items that had word-initial phonological overlap with the target word. We
      hypothesized that German-English bilinguals would fixate the German competitor
      items more in the culturally salient condition than in the culturally neutral
      condition. Preliminary data from seven German-English bilinguals and 10 English
      monolinguals revealed a competitor effect in the culturally salient condition
      only for bilinguals (p=.03), with no effect in the culturally-neural condition
      (p&gt;.1). Results suggest that activation of cultural knowledge in bilinguals
      exerts a conceptual top-down influence on parallel language activation. </p>
