	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Decision making from sequential sampling, especially when more
      than two alternative choices are possible, requires appropriate stopping criteria
      to maximize accuracy under time constraints. Optimal conditions for stopping have
      previously been investigated for modeling human decision making processes. In
      this work, we show how the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm in machine
      learning can be utilized as a mathematical framework to derive a variety of novel
      sequential sampling models. We interpret these nearest neighbor models in the
      context of diffusion decision making (DDM) methods. We compare these nearest
      neighbor methods to exemplar-based models and accumulator models, such as Race
      and LCA. Computational experiments show that the new models demonstrate
      significantly higher accuracy given equivalent time constraints.</p>
