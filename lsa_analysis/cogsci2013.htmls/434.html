	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Would Dan have died if Bob hadn&#8217;t shot? In this paper, we
      show that people&#8217;s answer depends on whether or not they are asked about
      what would have caused Bob not to shoot. Something needs to change in order to
      turn an actual world into a counterfactual world. Previous findings of how people
      reason about counterfactuals have been mixed: sometimes people appear to
      backtrack and reevaluate the causes of a counterfactual state (e.g. Rips, 2010).
      At other times, people appear to treat counterfactuals like interventions that
      leave the past unchanged (Sloman & Lagnado, 2005). We experimentally manipulated
      the order in which participants were asked to consider the consequences of a
      counterfactual state. The results show that participants are more likely to
      backtrack when explicitly asked to consider a counterfactual&#8217;s causes.
      However, when directly asked about the effects of a counterfactual state, most
      people don&#8217;t backtrack.</p>
