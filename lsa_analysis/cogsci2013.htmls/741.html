	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In many domains of cognitive psychology, it is proposed that
      people are equipped with a repertoire of strategies to solve the problems they
      face. For instance, it is proposed that when people use multiple cues to make a
      probabilistic inference about a criterion, they sometimes rely on simple
      heuristics and sometimes apply more elaborate additive strategies. Indeed, many
      studies suggest that people&#8217;s inferences can be described by different
      strategies in different situations. However, critics of this view suggest that
      people do not apply different strategies but instead adjust one single strategy
      to the characteristics of each situation. Here we examine the strategies that
      individuals use when available resources change. Therefore, we continuously
      change the cost of deliberation time. The behavior of participants at the
      transition from fast and simple behavior to slow but optimal information
      integration offers insight into whether people select different strategies or
      continuously adjust one single strategy. </p>
