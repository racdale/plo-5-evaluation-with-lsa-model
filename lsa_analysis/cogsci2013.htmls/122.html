	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Little is known about the how the decision is made to terminate
      memory search, though there have been several recent attempts to uncover this
      process. In one recent study, Miller et al. (2012), re-analyzed data from a large
      number of free-recall experiments and identified intrusions as a factor that
      influenced search termination decisions. One potential problem with this
      re-analysis is that all the data were drawn from experiments in which it was
      impossible to determine if or when search was terminated. Using data from
      experiments in which search termination decisions were directly measured, we
      confirmed Miller at al.'s (2012) original findings but also demonstrated that
      intrusions influence the time taken to generate the final retrieval and the time
      between the final retrieval and search termination. The pattern of data is
      consistent with a simple, sample-with-replacement model in which intrusions are
      less active than items from the target list.</p>
