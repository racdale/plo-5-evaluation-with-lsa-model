	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Generalization to new examples is an essential aspect of
      categorization. However, recent category learning research has not focused on how
      people generalize their category knowledge. Taking generalization to be a
      critical basis for evaluating formal models of category learning, we employed a
      &#8216;minimal case&#8217; approach to begin a systematic investigation of
      generalization. Human participants received supervised training on a two-way
      artificial classification task based on two dimensions that were each perfect
      predictors. Learners were then asked to classify new examples sampled from the
      stimulus space. Most participants based their judgments on one or the other
      dimension. Varying the relative levels of dimension salience influenced
      generalization outcomes, but varying category size (2, 4, or 8 items) did not. We
      fit two theoretically distinct similarity-based models (ALCOVE and DIVA) to
      aggregate learning data and tested on the generalization set. Both models could
      explain important aspects of human performance, but DIVA produced a superior
      overall account. </p>
