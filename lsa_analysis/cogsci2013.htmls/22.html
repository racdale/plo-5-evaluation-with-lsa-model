	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Traditional views of cognition, cognitive development, and word
      learning have viewed knowledge as divorced from processes of perceiving and
      acting. Linda Smith has championed a dynamic, mechanistic, and processoriented
      view of cognition and focused on questions of development. She has shown how
      knowledge is embedded in, distributed across, and inseparable from the processes
      of perceiving and acting in the world. In so doing, she has enabled a new
      understanding of the nature of cognition and of how new ways of thinking come to
      be. This Rumelhart symposium in her honor illustrates how this focus on
      developmental process changes the questions asked and our resulting understanding
      of cognition. The five speakers will examine the developmental process of word
      learning from different vantage points ranging from perceptual to social to
      cognitive, and spanning multiple periods from the first words to rapid vocabulary
      growth to the building of semantic networks.</p>
