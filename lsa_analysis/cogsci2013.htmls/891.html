	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>People often rely on popular scientific information when seeking
      advice for health-related issues. In these cases, further usage of such
      information should be influenced by its presentation. With N  = 157 students, we
      examined how referring to the tentativeness of health information by using hedges
      and pointing to the origin of scientific knowledge in science-related texts
      impacts processes of decision-making. We found that decisions were easier to make
      when there was no indication given. Furthermore, participants&#8217; further use
      of text-related information was more likely when hedges were used. In contrast,
      individuals rather relied on their own knowledge when there were no linguistic
      markers of tentativeness. Additionally, participants&#8217; decisions were more
      in favor of the direction implied in the texts when no indication of the sources
      of the science-related information was given. However, no effect of experimental
      manipulation on the confidence of the decisions exists. Finally, we discuss how
      the presentation of information may contribute to engaging in critical and
      elaborated processing of scientific information.</p>
