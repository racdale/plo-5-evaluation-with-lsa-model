	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In noisy domains where category distributions overlap, people
      categorise better at test after being trained on idealised category structures.
      This may happen, because under the assumption that humans selectively sample from
      memory when performing categorisation, idealised category learning leads to
      sampling of more appropriate items and better performance. Here we propose that
      idealisation of category distributions occurs naturally via a process of
      forgetting and re-estimation of category labels.

      We model a process in which items&#8217; category membership is forgotten and
      then re-estimated from the remaining distributions. With time this leads to
      lowering the variance of category distributions, equivalent to idealising
      training data. We test this potential idealisation in a paradigm in which we
      train participants on overlapping category distributions and withdraw feedback
      for some trials in one group thus enforcing re-estimation of categories. The
      model predicts that the group with less feedback will perform better at test due
      to idealisation.</p>
