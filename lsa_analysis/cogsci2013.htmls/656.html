	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Young children&#8217;s collaboration is a topic of great interest,
      yet what causes children to initiate collaboration in some circumstances but not
      others is unclear.  In this research, we analyzed preschoolers&#8217;
      collaboration as an information gathering activity in a toy assembly activity. 
      We independently assessed children&#8217;s competency at a similar building task
      and, using a separate group of children, the difficulty of each step of the
      activity.  We hypothesized that children would request collaborative assistance
      when they needed assistance (that is, when they were less competent and/or the
      task was more difficult), but act independently when capable.  The results
      confirmed that preschoolers were more likely to request collaborative assistance
      as the difficulty of the activity increased and more so if they were initially
      less competent.  The results suggest that preschoolers&#8217; collaboration may
      be profitably viewed as an information gathering activity.</p>
