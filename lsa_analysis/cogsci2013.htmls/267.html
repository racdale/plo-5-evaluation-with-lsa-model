	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study examines the decisions made by reasoners when
      they are asked to revise their beliefs in the face of new, counterfactual
      information. Participants indicated the Scope (the degree of set inclusion) of
      semantic generalizations about real categories in a Pretest. In subsequent
      experiments, these Scope values were used to predict the willingness of
      participants to retain statements in their existing knowledge sets. When those
      sets were logically compatible with a Modus Tollens (MT) structure, participants
      were more likely to retain the general statements, but not when the sets were
      logically compatible with a Modus Ponens (MP) structure. However, the MP
      retention rates increased when locatives were added to the generalizations. These
      findings are inconsistent with several prevailing proposals of belief revision
      but do support the concept of belief revision as following Possible Worlds
      logic.</p>
