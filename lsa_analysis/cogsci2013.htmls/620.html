	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The benefits of collaborative activities have been demonstrated in
      many domains, but there remain mixed results across several others as to whether
      collaborative groups can achieve greater performance than individuals, and can
      achieve greater performance than nominal group comparisons. Here we develop a
      task that is especially suited to testing collaborative gains. In a collaborative
      crossword game, two individuals solved puzzle questions either alone or
      collaboratively through discussion. When talking, participants solved more puzzle
      questions, solved them more quickly and accurately, and in general seemed to
      recall the words from collaborative contexts better than from matched independent
      contexts. By extracting the audio of their interaction, we also demonstrate
      interesting relationships between spoken interaction and performance on the
      collaborative tasks. This task environment further substantiates the notion that,
      in the context of knowledge retrieval, two heads are better than one.</p>
