	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study investigates to what extent visual saliency cues in
      realistic visual scenes cause speakers to include a redundant color attribute in
      their definite descriptions of objects, and in particular how such cues guide
      speakers in determining which objects in the scene are relevant distractors, and
      which not. First, regarding bottom-up cues, the results revealed that the
      presence of clutter positively affected the redundant use of color, but that the
      distance between a target and a distractor did not have an effect in this
      respect. Second, an effect of top-down saliency (i.e., whether a target&#8217;s
      type was mentioned in the instructions) was only partially borne out by the data.
      We argue that these findings are problematic for algorithms that aim to generate
      psychologically realistic object descriptions, since these generally select
      properties that help to distinguish a target from all distractors that are
      present in a scene.</p>
