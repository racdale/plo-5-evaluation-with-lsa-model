	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Models of word recognition assume that information about the
      orthographic form of a word (morpheme) must be available before access to that
      word's (morpheme's) meaning is possible. In prior work we have demonstrated that
      semantic similarity influences even early morphological priming (Feldman,
      Kosti&#263;, Gvozdenovi&#263;, O&#8217;Connor, & Mart&#237;n, 2012; Feldman &
      Mart&#237;n, 2009). 

      In two experiments conducted in English, we used a forward-masked lexical
      decision task to assess whether processing differs after exhaustively
      decomposable (stem+affix; e.g., pastor-PAST) and partially decomposable
      (stem+nonmorphemic string; e.g., pasta-PAST) primes in semantically dissimilar
      prime-target pairs. 

      Results using linear mixed effect models on inverse transformed (-1000/RT)
      latency data with two separate PCs for the contributions of form (negative) and
      for frequency (negative) and previous RT as a predictor, failed to show different
      patterns of facilitation after exhaustively and partially decomposable primes;
      both of which differed from unrelated controls. Spelling did not interact with
      prime type but poor spellers varied more across the session.
