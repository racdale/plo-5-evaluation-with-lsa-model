	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the influence of reflections on self/others&#8217;
      trust within group-based problem solving. We assessed the role of trust dynamics
      on perspective-taking activities within conflictive groups, extending the
      experimental framework used by Hayashi (2012) and including conversational agents
      for controlling participants&#8217; interactions related to trust dynamics and
      perspective taking behavior. Results showed that (1) reflections of self/other
      trust in conflictive groups may influence trust towards other members, and (2)
      reflections of trust by members with conflicting perspectives may facilitate
      trust and perspective taking. This suggests that the level of trust dynamics
      facilitates trust and can function to manifest perspective taking within
      cooperative groups.</p>
