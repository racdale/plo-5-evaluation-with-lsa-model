	<h1>Not Emergence as Emergence: Emergence in Artificial Intelligence and in Philosophy of Mind</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Hardly any concept is as frequented as emergence in current
      cognitive science. For many authors it has become solution of eternal
      psychophysical problem, for many it has been only a mysterious incantation in
      regard to this. This poster should point out that concept of emergence as well as
      many other promising concepts has a fundamental problem with determination,
      definition and usage. The thesis is evident from the title: not emergence as
      emergence, or better: like emergence, not like emergence. There are many
      different concepts of emergence. The contribution is based on the belief that the
      confrontation of  artificial intelligence with philosophy of mind, the comparison
      of these two areas in which emergence occurs very often, could be interesting and
      could enable to formulate or outline certain tendencies in understanding and
      using of the concept.</p>
