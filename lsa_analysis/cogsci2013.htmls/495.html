	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Mental Time Travel (MTT) is, roughly, an individual&#8217;s
      capacity to project herself into the past or future by remembering or imagining
      first-personal experiences respectively. MTT is further presumed to have a
      distinct, concrete though dispersed neural correlate, and hence describes a
      neuro-cognitive phenomenon.
      Opening with a brief sketch of the development and current state of the art, the
      essay pursues three central aims: Firstly, it constitutes a plea for more
      conceptual rigour on the cognitive side of the fence, so as to ensure that
      meaningful lessons can be drawn from neurological enquiry about it. Secondly, a
      partial conceptual qualification of the necessary requirements of MTT as
      traditionally conceived is proposed, as they seem vague, uninformative and
      arbitrary. Finally, a revision of MTT is attempted, which aspires to include a
      variety of mental states so far not associated with MTT. MTT, as it is currently
      defined and investigated, I will argue, stands too heavily in the genealogical
      debt of research into episodic memory, and suffers from an astonishing neglect of
      considerations pertaining to imagination.</p>
