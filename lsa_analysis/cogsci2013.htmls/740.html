	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When individuals are presented with complex arrays at
      non-canonical orientations (e.g., rotated text) they frequently physically rotate
      to approximate the orientation of the stimulus (i.e., external normalization).
      One view of this natural behavior is that individuals are offloading internal
      cognitive demands (e.g., internal normalization) by adopting an external solution
      (i.e., external normalization). We test this account here by combining a stimulus
      rotation manipulation with a stimulus repetition manipulation. Previous research
      has demonstrated that stimulus repetition reduces the cost of stimulus rotation
      on performance. In other words, repetition putatively reduces the
      &#8220;internal&#8221; costs of stimulus rotation. Thus, stimulus repetition
      should reduce the frequency of external normalization. Consistent with the
      cognitive offloading account, repetition reduced the frequency of spontaneous
      physical head rotations while individuals read rotated text. Discussion focuses
      on the implication of these results for understanding cognitive offloading and
      the embodied and embedded nature of cognition.</p>
