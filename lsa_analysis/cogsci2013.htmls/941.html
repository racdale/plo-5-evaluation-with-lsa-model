	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent research supports the notion that word learning can be
      conceptualized as a statistical learning process. As many have noted however,
      statistical learning is constrained by processes such as attention and memory.
      Here we tested an attentionally constrained framework of statistical word
      learning. We observed, through infant-perspective head cameras, infants&#8217;
      visual input as parents labeled novel objects during an infant-parent object-play
      session. We then constructed statistical learning models that aggregate
      word-to-object associations. We fed a baseline model the word-to-object
      co-occurrence patterns obtained from parent-infant observations. We fed an
      attentionally constrained model weighted co-occurrence patterns based on the
      perceptual properties of the objects (i.e., object sizes from the infant&#8217;s
      view) at the time words were uttered. Models&#8217; learning was compared to
      children&#8217;s forced-choice test results. Of interest is which of the two
      models best approximates children&#8217;s learning. Implications of these results
      for statistical learning accounts of word learning will be discussed.       </p>
