	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Learning to linguistically encode spatial relations is
      traditionally considered a problem of acquiring the meanings of prepositions (in,
      on, under). Based on production data from English speaking 4-year-olds,
      6-year-olds and adults, we provide evidence for an alternative verb-based
      hypothesis: children and adults may essentially share spatial concepts and
      prepositional semantics, differing primarily in their use of lexical verbs (hang,
      stick, attach) to describe spatial relations. This hypothesis was formalized as a
      hierarchical generative model in which child and adult spatial descriptions are
      drawn from a common distribution, modulo a penalty on lexical verbs that is
      stronger for children. The model accounted for child production data
      significantly better than a model based on average adult performance, and the
      strengths of the estimated penalties were overall greater for 4-year-olds than
      for 6-year-olds, suggesting a developmental process in which lexical verbs
      gradually become integrated into the linguistic system for describing spatial
      relations. </p>
