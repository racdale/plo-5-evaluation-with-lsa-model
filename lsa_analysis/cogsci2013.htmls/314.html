	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present results from a new paradigm: mass participation games.
      In our experiments, hundreds of people can play a computer game simultaneously
      using audience response handsets. We can collect responses from a lecture hall
      full of people with the precision of a laboratory cubicle. We have studied two
      games: continuous, action games where participants cooperate to achieve a goal;
      and decision- making paradigms in which participants make repeated choices to
      maximise their own or the group&#8217;s rewards. We address a range of
      theoretical questions with experimental manipulations and computer modelling. Do
      participants play as if they were alone, or as a group? If so, do they represent
      the group as a single entity, or a collection of other agents? What are the
      dynamics of these behaviours, with learning across many trials? Lastly, what does
      it feel like to act in concert, or in competition, with a room full of
      people?</p>
