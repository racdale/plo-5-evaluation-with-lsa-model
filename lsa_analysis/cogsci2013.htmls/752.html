	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Constant entropy rate (CER) and uniform information density (UID)
      are two hypotheses that have been put forward to explain a wide rage of
      linguistic phenomena. However, the concrete definition of these hypotheses is
      unclear for statistical research and a direct and in-depth evaluation of these
      hypotheses from their definition is missing to our knowledge. Here we consider
      four operational definitions of UID: full UID (UID holding for any combination of
      elements making the utterances), strong UID (UID holding for any utterance that
      has non-zero probability) and initial UID (strong UID holding for utterances
      beginning with a particular element). Here we examine the logical dependencies
      between these hypotheses. The comparison of the assumptions and predictions of
      these hypothesis with Hilberg's law and other statistical properties of real
      human language indicates that CER and related hypotheses are qualitative
      different from actual language and suggests that these hypotheses are incomplete
      and must be revised.
