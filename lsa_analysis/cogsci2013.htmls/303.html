	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Aesthetics and the arts have garnered more attention within
      cognitive science in recent years. Despite this increasing interest, "scientists
      of art" often focus on one of two areas: the formal properties of artworks
      themselves, or the mental processes involved in perceiving these works in an
      isolated, one-on-one encounter. In this paper, I review some representative
      examples of such work before suggesting some alternative ways that cognitive
      science might approach aesthetics and the arts -- ways that would complement the
      isolationist approaches that have predominated to this point. In doing so, I draw
      on the observations and arguments of various philosophers of art, highlighting
      some of the socially and culturally situated factors that are important in
      shaping the development of our taste and sensibilities.</p>
