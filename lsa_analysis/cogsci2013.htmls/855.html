	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Tests modify memory and can improve memory performance: Practice
      tests outperform additional study trials as a learning technique when the final
      memory test is difficult (e.g., delayed in time). This is referred to as the
      testing effect. Although existing theories propose single mechanisms to underlie
      this effect, the contributions of different cognitive processes are yet to be
      dissociated. Because most testing-effect accounts attribute the testing advantage
      to either encoding, maintenance, or retrieval processes, we propose a multinomial
      processing-tree model that disentangles the contributions of all three memory
      processes. By applying this model to testing-effect data, we show that (a)
      testing memory primarily creates maintenance benefits (i.e., resistance against
      forgetting) and that (b) the critical interaction of testing vs. study benefits
      with final-test delay is not driven by different retrieval strengths. Our results
      thus support maintenance accounts of the testing effect and are difficult to
      reconcile with retrieval-based explanations.</p>
