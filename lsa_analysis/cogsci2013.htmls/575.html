	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Most computational models of analogy assume they are given a
      delineated source domain and often a specified target domain.  These systems do
      not address how analogs can be isolated from large domains and spontaneously
      retrieved from long-term memory, a process we call spontaneous analogy.  We
      present a system that represents relational structures as feature bags.  Using
      this representation, our system leverages perceptual algorithms to automatically
      create an ontology of relational structures and to efficiently retrieve analogs
      for new relational structures from long-term memory.  We provide a demonstration
      of our approach that takes a set of unsegmented stories, constructs an ontology
      of analogical schemas (corresponding to plot devices), and uses this ontology to
      efficiently find analogs within new stories, yielding significant time-savings
      over linear analog retrieval at a small accuracy cost.
