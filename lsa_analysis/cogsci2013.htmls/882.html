	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When engaging in concurrent multitasking, it quickly becomes clear
      that some activities combine well, while others do not. But which factors
      determine the compatibility of different tasks? We propose that the overlap in
      cognitive resources causes interference between tasks that limit performance, and
      that this performance can be predicted using a cognitive model. To test this, we
      built a model of three tasks, each using a well-defined set of cognitive
      resources. These tasks were executed separately as well as concurrently and the
      performance of the model was recorded. Afterwards, we ran an experiment where
      participants had to perform the same paradigm. Our results show that the model
      prediction has a good qualitative fit to the participant data: task combinations
      with more resource overlap had lower performance when performed concurrently,
      compared to combinations with little or no overlap.</p>
