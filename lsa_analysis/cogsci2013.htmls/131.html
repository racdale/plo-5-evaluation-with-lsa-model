	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Reasoning about others' preferences is an important aspect of
      understanding the social world. Although there is some evidence that young
      children reason appropriately about others' discrepant preferences, there are
      reasons to suspect this  ability remains fragile through the preschool years. In
      particular, we argue that the way preferences are expressed may tap into humans'
      lifelong tendency toward na&#239;ve realism, the belief that my way of seeing the
      world is the normative, correct one. We present data demonstrating that tolerance
      for unconventional opinions increases during the preschool years but remains
      susceptible to influence by linguistic framing.</p>
