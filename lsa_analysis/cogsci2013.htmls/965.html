	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined the effects of participants&#8217; linguistic
      expertise on their communicative behaviors and their interactional attitudes in
      conversations in their second language. Quantitative analyses of eye-gazes during
      utterances showed that the speakers with lower linguistic expertise were observed
      more by the listeners in the second language conversations, whereas, the
      listeners' expertise level did not affect the amount of their gazes to the
      speakers. The analyses of a questionnaire suggested that the participants with
      lower expertise were not conscious of their own gazing activities; they
      self-evaluated the amount of their gazes to the speakers' eyes much lower in
      conversations in their second language than those in their native language. The
      participants with lower expertise evaluated the pressure they felt higher than
      those with higher expertise. It is likely that they were too occupied with
      conducting conversations to maintain enough control over their interaction
      activities.
