	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Early word learning may be supported by a developmental feedback
      loop: the kind of words a child learns early on support the development of
      attentional biases, which in turn facilitate further word learning. In neural
      network simulations and a longitudinal study of toddlers we investigated how the
      emergence of an attentional bias to shape in word learning impacts vocabulary
      growth with respect to different kinds of words. If this relationship is causal,
      we should see that the emergence of a shape bias leads to an increase in the rate
      of learning of shape-based words relative to other kinds of words. The networks
      supported this prediction, showing an acceleration of shape- compared to
      material-based word learning. However, in toddlers, shape- and material-based
      words were learned similarly around the shape bias emergence. Implications are
      discussed for the developmental feedback loop account and causal relationships
      between attentional bias development and vocabulary growth.</p>
