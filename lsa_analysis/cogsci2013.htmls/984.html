	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Spoken words are phonologically reduced through various processes
      (e.g., assimilation) in fluent speech. The reduced forms of words give rise to
      perceptual difficulties for nonnative speakers. This study examined whether
      accent types (General American and Received Pronunciation (PR) British Englishes)
      of native English fluent speech affect fluent speech perception in Chinese
      speakers. A representative sample of sixty undergraduate students were tested
      with listening comprehension tests (recordings produced by American and British
      English speakers), reduced forms dictation test (with American- and
      British-accented speech as stimuli) and fluent speech production task. Based on
      correlational analyses, it is shown that listening comprehension was
      significantly correlated with both fluent speech perception and production skills
      among the Chinese speakers. Importantly, these correlations were observed within
      the same accent type and across the two accents. However, our regression analyses
      showed that speech perception rather than production significantly predicted the
      outcome of listening comprehension. </p>
