	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Social evaluations depend on our ability to interpret other
      people&#8217;s behavior. In adults, these evaluations are influenced by our
      perception of the competence and motivation of the agent: helping when it is
      difficult to help is praiseworthy; not helping when it is easy to help is
      reprehensible. Here we look at young children&#8217;s capacity to make competence
      attributions and its relation to their social evaluations. We find that as early
      as 18-months, infants can use the time and effort associated with achieving a
      goal-directed action to distinguish agents, and that infants prefer more
      competent agents. When asked to choose between two agents who act as moral
      bystanders and refuse to engage in a helpful action, we find a sustained
      preference for the more competent agent until the age of three, when the
      preference is reversed. We argue that the ability to calculate the cost and
      benefits of goal-directed action originates in early childhood and plays a
      fundamental role in moral reasoning.</p>
