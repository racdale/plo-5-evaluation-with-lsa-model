	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Past studies have indicated that intonation, in the sense of
      fundamental frequency modulation, can only enhance serial recall to the extent
      that it can induce a grouping effect, something that can also be induced by a
      simple insertion of pauses. However, in a study of spoken serial recall of
      nine-digit lists, we are able to show that recall is significantly better when
      sequences of digits are marked by specific intonation contours than when they are
      simply grouped by silent pauses in the signal. Thus, we found that intonation
      plays a role during the encoding phase, whereby items in group-final positions
      draw particular benefit from intonation.  However, intonation does not appear to
      play the same role in the retrieval phase, since when subjects are instructed to
      imitate intonation during recall, performance shows mixed effects.</p>
