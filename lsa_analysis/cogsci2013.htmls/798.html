	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We used a prototype-distortion task and adopted ERPs to test
      between prototype and exemplar theories on categorization, which suggest that
      categories are represented as a prototype via an abstraction process or via
      storing previously encountered exemplars in memory, respectively. In Experiments
      1 and 2, participants were presented low- or high-distortion category-members
      (i.e., dot-patterns) without anticipating subsequent categorization or
      recognition test. They were more likely to process low-distortions via prototype
      abstraction in both tests, and differently process high-distortions via prototype
      abstraction in categorization test, but via storing exemplars in recognition
      test. In Experiment 3, participants were explicitly instructed to do
      categorization or recognition task. We found that participants did categorization
      test via prototype abstraction (N1) only for studied items, not for unstudied
      items. And conversely did recognition via familiarity processing (FN400) only for
      category-members, not for non-members. In conclusion, the nature of category
      representations depends on the experimental contexts.</p>
