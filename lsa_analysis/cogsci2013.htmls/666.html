	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Learning-by-invention is an approach to mathematical
      instruction where small groups explore possible methods of
      solution before learning the &#8220;right answer&#8221; (e.g., Schwartz &
      Martin, 2004; Kapur & Bielaczyc, 2011). In a series of studies
      we have been investigating the effects of group composition
      in terms of math ability on learning by invention. An initial
      result showed that groups consisting of a mix of both high and
      low math ability students generated a broader range of
      solution attempts when asked to invent a formula for standard
      deviation compared to more homogeneous math ability
      groups. Moreover, this wider range of solution alternatives
      predicted better performance on quizzes following a lesson on
      the topic. Subsequent work is suggesting that who emerges as
      the leader of the group matters. Ongoing analyses are also
      exploring which features of the collaborative discourse are
      critical for students to take advantage of the affordances of
      learning by invention.</p>
