	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Perceptual categorization is a key problem for an agent to cope
      with its internal and external world. Following a functional and subjective
      approach of cognitive modeling, the primary purpose of perceptual categorization
      is modeled as the valuation of a stimulus regarding its potential to satisfy an
      agent&#8217;s current needs. Additionally an integrated and holistic approach is
      used, where categorization considers the integration of subjective influences.
      Such an approach complies with the consideration of top-down perception and
      priming. Using an activation-based exemplar model, the objective criterion of
      perceptual similarity, which represents bottom-up aspects of perception, and the
      subjective expectation-based criterion of cathexis, which represents top-down
      aspects of perception, are integrated in a holistic multi-criteria model of
      perceptual categorization. An Artificial Life simulation demonstrates the
      model&#8217;s ability to relate stimulus objects to an agent&#8217;s internal
      needs. Additionally, the usage of multiple criteria provides a more confident
      valuation of stimulus objects.</p>
