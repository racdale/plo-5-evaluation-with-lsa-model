	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present poster discusses the role of the famous Quinian
      bootstrapping learning process in the acquisition of mental state terms such as
      happy, believe, pain, etc. At first, the poster characterises  Quinian
      bootstrapping in which the so-called placeholder structure plays an important
      role. The placeholder structure consists of symbols whose meanings are initially
      learned in terms of each other. Later, the placeholder structure is infused with
      meanings via the so-called modelling processes. A modelling process can be
      analogical mapping, abduction, induction, etc. Susan Carey (2009) introduced
      Quinian bootstrapping in her explanation of the acquisition of numeral list
      representation and rational number as well as certain aspects of intuitive
      physics. Second, I apply this well-known learning mechanism to the acquisition of
      the meaning of mental terms. I distinguish between three stages in the learning
      of the semantics of mental words. The present poster will characterise the three
      stages in detail. </p>
