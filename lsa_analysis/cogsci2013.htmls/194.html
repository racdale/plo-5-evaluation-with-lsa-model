	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Technology has become integrated into many facets of our lives.
      Due to the rapid onset of this integration, many current K-12 teachers do not
      have the skills required to supply the sudden demand for technical training. This
      deficit, in turn, has created a demand for professional development programs that
      allow working teachers to learn computer science so that they might become
      qualified to teach this increasingly important field. Subgoal labeled worked
      examples have been found to improve the performance of learners in highly
      procedural domains. The present study tested subgoal labeled worked examples in
      an online learning program for teachers. Teachers who received the subgoal labels
      solved novel problems more accurately than teachers who received the same worked
      examples without the subgoal labels. These findings have implications for the use
      of subgoal labels in professional development, other types of lifelong learning,
      and online learning.</p>
