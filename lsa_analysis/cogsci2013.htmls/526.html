	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent works indicated that performing a joint spatial
      compatibility task with an incompatible stimulus-response mapping affects
      subsequent joint Simon task performance, eliminating the social Simon effect
      (social transfer of learning effect or SToL effect). Crucially, the SToL effect
      was not tuned to the specific identity of the co-actor, and depended on the
      overlap between the spatial relations of the practice and transfer tasks.
      Starting from these findings, this study aimed at investigating which spatial
      relations between stimulus (S), response (R) or participant (P) positions are
      relevant for the SToL effect to occur. Two experiments were run in which the
      participant-response associations were incompatible (participants were required
      to respond with crossed arms), whereas the  stimulus-response and
      stimulus-participant associations were manipulated. We found that learning
      derived from the practice task did not transfer to the subsequent task when
      stimulus-response associations were spatially incompatible and
      stimulus-participant associations were compatible (Experiment 1). However, a SToL
      effect was evident when stimulus-participant associations were spatially
      incompatible and stimulus-response associations were compatible (Experiment 2),
      hence suggesting that the spatial relation between stimulus and participant
      positions is crucial for the SToL effect to occur.</p>
