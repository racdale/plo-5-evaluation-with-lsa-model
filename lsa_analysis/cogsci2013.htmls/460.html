	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present research investigates semantic priming with an adapted
      version of the word fragment completion task. The letter decision task, as we
      will call it, holds some advantages over the traditionally used lexical decision
      task in that it eliminates retrospective semantic matching effects, it avoids the
      need to construct pseudowords, it is more engaging for participants and it
      enhances semantic processing, which in turn allows for a more fine-grained
      investigation of semantic activation. The letter decision task requires
      participants to complete words, from which one letter was omitted like lett_ce
      (lettuce), as fast as possible. The study found that words are completed faster
      when the preceding trial comprised a semantically related fragment like tom_to
      (tomato) than when it comprised an unrelated fragment like guit_r (guitar).
      Furthermore, the study provides insight in the nature of the priming effect. It
      demonstrates that priming effects are larger for strongly associated prime-target
      pairs.</p>
