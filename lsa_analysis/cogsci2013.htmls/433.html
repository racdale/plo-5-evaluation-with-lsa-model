	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Learning to plan sequences of actions and appropriately adapt our
      actions during interactions with others are both critical skills upon which much
      of human society is built. We know that children&#8217;s joint action and
      planning skills are both undergoing development during the preschool years, but
      not much is known about how the joint action context influences young
      children&#8217;s planning. In this study, we examined the effect of playing alone
      or with a joint partner on sequence planning during a problem-solving game in
      three-year-old children. We found that children were better at planning ahead in
      the individual than the joint condition of the game despite the joint condition
      requiring fewer actions on the part of the child. In contrast, children were
      equally good at problem-solving (i.e., correcting an error) in both conditions.
      The possible reasons for this difference and directions of future research are
      discussed.</p>
