	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Foraging is a search process common to mobile organisms, and
      foraging paths commonly exhibit statistical patterns akin to L&#233;vy walks.
      There may be common factors and benefits underlying these patterns, but
      investigations are hindered by difficulty in assessing and manipulating search
      environments and task conditions. In the present study, a simple foraging game
      was developed to isolate and manipulate two factors hypothesized to make
      L&#233;vy walks adaptive search strategies&#8212;sparsity, and spatial clustering
      of targets in the search environment. Players navigated a fuel-limited ship over
      a 2D grid to find as many targets as possible, rendered as asteroids in outer
      space. Over 1800 participants were recruited to play using Amazon&#8217;s
      Mechanical Turk, in order to widely sample the parameter space defined by degrees
      of target sparsity and clustering. Observed search paths resembled L&#233;vy
      walks with memory, and those of high performers were found to vary adaptively
      with clustering, but not sparsity. Results indicate that L&#233;vy-like walks can
      emerge from search strategies and algorithms adapted to environments with
      clustered resources.</p>
