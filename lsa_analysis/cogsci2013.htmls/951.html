	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Some classically rational standards for actions such as
      optimization are simply intractable. We often instead satisfice a certain
      reference level that is good enough for us. We can use some heuristics but they
      may lead to biases. Though rational analysis by Anderson (1990) can argue the
      adaptive rationality of biases in relation to the environmental structure,
      heuristics and biases have been mostly studied in isolation from other factors in
      conformity with the tradition in psychology. To show the efficacy of the
      subrational heuristics in union, we execute computer simulations adopting the
      framework of reinforcement learning that models iterative decision-making under
      uncertainty. We implement three characteristics representative of human behavior:
      Satisficing (Simon, 1952), risk attitudes and reflection (Tversky & Kahneman,
      1981), and comparative valuation (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). We show that they,
      combined together, exhibit an adaptively optimal behavior with an extremely easy
      parameter tuning.</p>
