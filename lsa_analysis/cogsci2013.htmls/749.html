	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Prior research in learning with graphic organizers has revealed
      that learners can make use of graphical overviews to increase their learning in
      online environments, especially when these visual supports are provided before
      learning. This research examined the extent to which the format of feedback in an
      online learning environment impacts students&#8217; processes and outcomes during
      a self-regulated learning task. Students wrote scientific essays that were
      analyzed by a personalized learning service (the customized learning service for
      conceptual knowledge: CLICK). Feedback on essay content was presented using
      either a visual (node-link) representation or a (text-based) list view.
      Preliminary data reveal that learners presented with the visually-based feedback
      engaged in more effective self-regulated learning processes (i.e., planning and
      goal-setting) compared to learners provided with list-based feedback. Results
      demonstrate that the format of external feedback in self-regulated learning
      environments play an important role in supporting students&#8217; implementation
      of effective self-regulated learning strategies.</p>
