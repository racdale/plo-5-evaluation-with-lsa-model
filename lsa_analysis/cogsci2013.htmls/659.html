	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There is controversy concerning the question of whether meaning
      can be extracted from a parafoveal word during reading and whether this might
      occur in an overlapping fashion with the lexical processing of the
      currently-fixated word. We suggest that previous attempts to investigate this
      have been bedevilled by problems associated with the use of priming methodology. 
      Instead, we used an eye movement contingent change technique and manipulated the
      plausibility of the parafoveal preview, resulting in it being either valid, a
      plausible alternative, anomalous, or an illegal letter string. The results showed
      (a) a meaning-based parafoveal-on-foveal effect, (b) preview benefits driven by
      both orthographic and semantic influences, and (c) continuing disruption
      associated with orthographically dissimilar previews. We suggest that this
      pattern is most consistent with models of eye movement control that allow for
      distributed attention during reading.</p>
