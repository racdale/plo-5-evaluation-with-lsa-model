	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There is an ongoing debate on whether semantic interference
      effects in language production reflect competitive lexical selection or
      post-lexical response exclusion mechanisms driven by the response-relevant status
      of distractor words.

      To disentangle categorical relatedness and task-defined response relevance
      effects, we combined the picture-word interference task with the conditional
      naming paradigm in an orthogonal design. Participants were instructed to name
      objects typically located in or on the water (e.g. canoe) and refrain from naming
      objects typically located outside the water (e.g. bike), and vice versa. Semantic
      relatedness and response relevance of distractors were manipulated independently.
      Linear mixed model analyses were conducted with semantic similarity ratings of
      target-distractor as continuous predictor. 

      The pattern of results revealed that semantic similarity beyond categorical
      relations is critical for interference effects to be observed, and not response
      relevance. These findings provide support for the assumption that lexical
      selection is competitive and that semantic interference effects in the PWI
      paradigm reflect this competition.
