	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Past research suggests that spatial configurations play an
      important role in graph comprehension.  The present study investigates
      consequences of this fact for the relative utility of graphs and tables for
      interpreting data.  Participants judged presence or absence of various
      statistical effects in simulated datasets presented in various formats.  For the
      statistical effects introduced earlier in the study, performance was better with
      graphs than with tables, while for the effect introduced last in the study, this
      trend reversed.  Additionally, in the later sections of the study, responses with
      graphs, but not tables, reflected increasing influence from the presence of
      stimulus features which had been relevant earlier in the study, but were no
      longer relevant. The findings suggest that graphs, relative to tables, may better
      facilitate perception of complex relationships among data points, but may also
      bias readers more strongly to favor some perspectives over others when
      interpreting data.</p>
