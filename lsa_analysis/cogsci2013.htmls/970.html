	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The degrees of separation are essential in the study of social
      networks. We develop a graph theoretical methodology inspired in this concept to
      study behavioral data. Having a similarity measure appropriate to the data, we
      propose to build a graph connecting each agent its nearest n neighbors, having
      that their similarity exceeds a threshold p. From here, graph theoretical
      indicators such as connectivity and clustering can be studied as functions of p
      and n.

      We apply this methodology to a psychological experiment where 97 participants
      estimate the typicality of 8 objects with respect to the concept
      &#8220;Hat&#8221;, in 2 contexts. Using correlation distance as a similarity
      function, we compute clustering properties, and average path length as functions
      of n and p. Interestingly, only n=20 connections are required to keep the
      similarity structure of the system, having an average path length near 2.
