	<h1>Conceptual Art and Cognitive Science: A Case Study in Space</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Conceptual art and cognitive science have more common ground than
      is acknowledged. For example, both disciplines are principally engaged in
      describing and visualizing facts about basic categories of mind (space, objects,
      language, etc.). Along these lines, conceptual art can inform the cognitive
      science of abstract concepts. Cognitive scientists studying aesthetics can also
      learn from conceptual artists to push their research forward. While empirical
      investigations in aesthetics typically focus on perceptual preferences (i.e.,
      &#8220;what is beauty?&#8221;), conceptual art often goes deeper ontologically
      (i.e., &#8220;what is art?&#8221;). This level of analysis can inform questions
      regarding the evolution of art and object processing. The present study examines
      the artwork of Mel Bochner who may have staged the first conceptual art
      exhibition (1966).  Bochner&#8217;s work addresses spatial
      semantics/representation, and anticipates the neuropsychological distinction
      between categorical and coordinate spatial relations; all while reconsidering
      what it means for an object to be thought of as art.</p>
