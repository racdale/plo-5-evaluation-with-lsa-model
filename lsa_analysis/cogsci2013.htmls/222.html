	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In a series of experiments conducted with Dutch native speakers,
      we explored systematic size/power sound-symbolic associations in novel and
      existing words. In Experiment 1 (N = 64),   participants associated
      vowel-intrinsic fundamental frequency with size/power, disregarding the modality
      of stimuli presentation (spoken, written), but depending on the lexical status of
      the stimulus (more strongly for novel then for existing words). In Experiment 2
      (N = 56), we explored the idea that the order of vowels in a word affects
      sound-symbolic associations, as pitch contours emerge from a sequence of
      vowel-intrinsic fundamental frequencies. Participants perceived stimuli with
      'rising' combinations of front-back vowels as less powerful than stimuli with
      &#8216;falling&#8217; combinations. This finding indicates that even in non-tonal
      languages, sound symbolism is not bound to a single segment (phoneme). We
      compared the effect to the perception of tones in a tonal language, which we
      explored in Experiment 3 with Mandarin native speakers (N = 96) judging the
      perception of power in monosyllabic novel brand names with four different tones
      (rising, falling, level and fall-rise). In Experiment 4 (N = 146), we examined
      the effect of vowel-intrinsic intensity, which has previously remained un-noted.
      The results showed that like fundamental frequency, also intrinsic intensity
      influences size/power-symbolic associations. </p>
