	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The rule versus rote distinction is one of the most debated issues
      in recent psycholinguistics. Dual route accounts hold that words can either be
      stored whole in the mental lexicon or computationally derived by simple
      combinatorial rules such as stem+affix. Within this framework, response latencies
      in lexical decision tasks have been applied to point out the difference between
      rote memorization, on the one hand, and combinatorial rule manipulation, on the
      other. However, this paper argues that there may be alternatives to this
      distinction. It will be shown that German nouns, which can be distinctively
      marked for number, case or both number and case, do elicit differing reaction
      times. Crucially, this effect can neither be explained by surface frequency
      effects nor by internal morphological structure. Rather, it seems to be triggered
      by the degree of embedding into usage-based units.</p>
