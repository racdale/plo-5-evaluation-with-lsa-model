	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Inflectional morphology has proven a test case for evaluating
      theoretical approaches to language processing. The bulk of empirical data has
      been acquired using the inflection from stem task, which approximates more
      naturalistic speech production only if mandatory stem retrieval is assumed. Yet
      work with adults reveals quite different results when inflection proceeds instead
      from meaning. Connectionist computational models of inflection have simulated
      these task differences, but the extent to which they accurately reflect
      development remains unknown. For the first time, we consider the impact of task
      type upon inflectional development of 908 children aged between 2 and 4 years. We
      then present a revised version of a connectionist model of inflection, which has
      been trained in a manner consistent with child directed speech in order to
      capture the children&#8217;s performance. Taken together, this work demonstrates
      the progression of the field to more ecologically and developmentally valid
      approaches to inflection.
