	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper presents the results of a computational model of
      generalized phonological rule learning (Calamaro and Jarosz, 2012), which is used
      to model experimental studies on the learning of phonotactic patterns governed by
      natural and unnatural classes. I focus on two papers with conflicting results on
      the learnability of natural and unnatural rules. Saffran and Thiessen (2003) find
      that a phonotactic pattern of positional voicing restrictions governed by a
      natural class of segments is learned by infants, but a similar pattern governed
      by an unnatural class is not learned. In contrast, Chambers, Onishi, and Fisher
      (2003) find that infants can learn a phonotactic pattern governed by an unnatural
      class of segments. The computational model presented in this paper is able to
      account for these seemingly conflicting results, explaining both the learnability
      and unlearnability of rules governed by unnatural classes. </p>
