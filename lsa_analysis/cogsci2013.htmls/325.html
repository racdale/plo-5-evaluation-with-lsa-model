	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There have been contradictory reports of sex differences in
      language processing. A novel approach is adopted here which
      explores the experiential basis of such differences. Two
      studies examine the auditory processing of grammatical
      gender in Bulgarian in a gender decision (gender monitoring)
      task and a cued shadowing (word repetition) task. Reaction
      times in both experiments reveal significant two-way
      interactions between the grammatical gender of words
      (masculine vs. feminine) and the sex of the voice (male vs.
      female). The sex of participants in the gender decision task
      also interacted with word gender in terms of decision
      accuracy. Women were relatively more accurate on their
      &#8220;own reference&#8221; word gender (feminine) and less accurate on
      masculine gender words. A two-way interaction between
      word gender and participant sex on response latencies in the
      cued shadowing task supports the view that these effects are
      not strategic but have a highly automatic nature instead.
      Findings are interpreted in terms of individual differences in
      the experience of grammatical gender in such gender-marking
      languages.</p>
