	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Time is talked about in terms of space more frequently than the
      opposite is true. Past experimental evidence suggests that this asymmetry runs
      deep, with results suggesting that temporal concepts and percepts find structure
      in spatial representations but not vice versa. However, these studies frequently
      involve verbal and/or visual stimuli.  Because vision makes a privileged
      contribution to spatial processing it is unclear whether these results speak to a
      deep asymmetry between time and space, or a modality specific one. The present
      study was motivated by this ambiguity and a complementary correspondence between
      audition and temporal processing.  In an auditory perceptual task, duration and
      spatial displacement judgments were shown to be mutually contagious.  Irrelevant
      temporal information influenced spatial judgments and vice versa with a larger
      effect of time on space. The results suggest that the perceptual asymmetry
      between domains does not generalize across modalities and that time is not
      fundamentally more abstract than space.</p>
