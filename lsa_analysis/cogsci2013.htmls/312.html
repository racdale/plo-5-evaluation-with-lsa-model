	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The crux of the Whorfian thesis is that our thought and behavior
      are influenced in deep ways by the language we use. In recent years we have seen
      a wave of rigorous and creative investigations of this thesis (Boroditsky, 2010;
      Wolff & Holmes, 2011 for reviews). Yet, many researchers remain highly skeptical
      of findings purporting to support Whorfian claims  (Gleitman & Papafragou, 2005),
      and much confusion remains about how to integrate these find-ings into existing
      theories of cognition. A major barrier to understanding the degree to which
      various aspects of human cognition may be affected by speaking different
      languages is understanding the relationship between language&#8212;any
      language&#8212;and the rest of cognition. To remove this barrier we need to
      address a fundamental question: To what degree is normal human cognition actually
      language-augmented cognition? I will argue that a surprising variety of behavior
      previously assumed to be &#8220;nonverbal&#8221; shows signs of being influenced
      by linguistic factors and I will outline a theory of language-augmented thought
      that offers a mechanistic account of where we might expect to find effects of
      language on &#8220;nonverbal&#8221; cognition (Lupyan, 2012a, 2012b, for
      reviews).</p>
