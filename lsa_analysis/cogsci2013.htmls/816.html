	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated KANSEI difference between a child and a caregiver
      in room arrangement workshop. Seven pairs of parents and children volunteered to
      participate in a workshop held in a university in Japan. In the workshop, each
      child and caregiver arranged a room layout using a prepared set of furniture. We
      then interviewed them about the layout of the arranged room and their own room at
      their home. We categorized their arrangement of the furniture into
      "center-arrangement" and "corner-arrangement" using video-data. Results show that
      half of the children arranged a piece of furniture in the center of the room
      whereas all caregivers arranged a piece of furniture at a corner. Interview data
      suggested this difference reflected their KANSEI differences such as preferred
      activities and perspectives toward room arrangement between children and
      caregivers.</p>
