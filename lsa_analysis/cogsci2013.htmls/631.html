	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Several studies have demonstrated that language encodes
      geographical information. That is, the relative longitude and latitude of city
      locations can be extracted from language. Whether people actually rely on these
      linguistic features is less clear. Recent studies have suggested that language
      statistics plays a role in geographical estimates, but these studies rely on map
      drawings, a fundamentally perceptual task. The current study investigated the
      extent to which people rely on map representations and statistical linguistic
      frequencies by using a linguistic task. Participants saw U.S. city pairs in their
      iconic positions (a more northern city is presented above a more southern city,
      or a more western city is presented to the left of a more eastern city), and in
      their reverse-iconic positions (a more southern city is presented above a more
      northern city, or a more eastern city is presented to the left of a more western
      city). For iconic city pairs both in the east &#8211; west (Seattle &#8211;
      Boston) and north &#8211; south (Memphis &#8211; Miami) configurations, RTs were
      determined by the iconicity. No effect was obtained for statistical linguistic
      frequencies. However, when city pairs were presented in a reverse-iconic
      configuration, for both horizontal (Boston &#8211; Seattle) and vertical (Miami
      &#8211; Memphis) orientations, both perceptual and linguistic factors explained
      RTs. These findings support the idea that cognition relies on a shallow
      heuristic, a linguistic system, and a fine-grained and more precise perceptual
      simulation system.</p>
