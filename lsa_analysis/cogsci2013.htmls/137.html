	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Quinian bootstrapping is Susan Carey's solution to Fodor&#8217;s
      paradox of concept learning. Carey claims that contrary to Fodor&#8217;s view,
      not all learning amounts to hypothesis testing, and that there are ways in which
      even primitive concepts can be learned. Recently Georges Rey has argued that
      Carey&#8217;s attempt to refute radical concept nativism is unsuccessful. First
      it cannot explain how the expressive power of mental representational systems
      could increase due to learning. Second, both Fodorian circularity charges and
      Goodmanian problems of indeterminacy apply to Carey&#8217;s examples of Quinian
      bootstrapping. I argue that Carey&#8217;s examples of bootstrapping can be
      amended to escape Fodorian and Goodmanian objections. I suggest some ways to
      improve on our models of concept learning to this end. I also argue that skill
      learning is the way for mental representational systems to increase their own
      expressive power, that is, to enrich their conceptual repertoire beyond what
      compositionality alone affords.</p>
