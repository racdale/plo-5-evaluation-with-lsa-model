	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The most popular way to improve consumers&#8217; control over
      their electricity cost is by providing frequent and detailed feedback with
      &#8220;in-home displays&#8221; (IHD). In this study, we examined alternative ways
      to train experimental participants to control and optimize their use of
      electricity by &#8220;feedforward&#8221; training to map energy consuming
      behaviors to costs. The participants were trained in one of four experimental
      conditions, one feedback (&#8220;IHD&#8221;) and three feedforward conditions
      before they had to control the electricity consumption in a simulated household.
      Results showed that one of the feedforward conditions produced somewhat higher
      utility and as good or better satisfaction of a monthly budget than the feedback
      training condition, despite never receiving any feedback about the monthly cost,
      but the generalization to a new budget constraint proved to be slightly
      poorer.</p>
