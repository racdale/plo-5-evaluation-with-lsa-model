	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A peer-based reviewing on writing often leads to improving
      learners&#8217; writing quality. Particularly, reviewing by writing comments
      lifted writing quality more greatly than reviewing without writing comments. This
      implies that learners&#8217; hard working on peers&#8217; writing engenders
      benefits on their own writing. This study attempted to explore which cognitive
      mechanism underlies in this cooperative learning system. We questioned whether
      learners&#8217; use of metacognitive strategies during reviewing might facilitate
      learners&#8217; self-learning. In a preliminary study, participants were asked to
      categorize their comments on peers&#8217; reports. Results from the study
      revealed that learners who categorized comments used metacognitive strategies
      more increasingly than those who did not. Controlling for the amount of using
      metacognitive strategies, writing quality was improved numerically more when
      learners were engaged in the categorization task than when they were not. With
      further data, we will examine to what degree learners&#8217; metacognitive
      learning during reviewing contribute to writing improvement. </p>
