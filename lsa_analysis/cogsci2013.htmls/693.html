	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cross-situational learning and mutual exclusivity are strategies
      proposed to explain the learning of word-meaning mappings. In this paper, seven
      possible strategies are explored and compared to the results of an artificial
      word learning experiment. The fixed order of trials in the experiment allows for
      an exposure-by-exposure approach to explore the individual learning process of
      words. The experiment shows that adult learners do indeed integrate knowledge
      from previous exposures, however they have difficulty in keeping track of
      cross-situational information for learning all twelve word-meaning mappings,
      although some learners can. The performance of 78 participants is compared to
      simulations in which various combinations of strategies were modeled. The results
      suggest that a random strategy with mutual exclusivity as its sole learning
      mechanism could explain the performance in the experiment. In this strategy, the
      learner selects an object at random from the context, provided that this object
      has not received a label yet.
