	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Motor representation is understood by Grush (2004) and Pezzulo
      (2008, 2011) in terms of simulation/emulation: internal models simulate motor
      effectors and environmental conditions.  Motor intentionality, thus, is regarded
      as based on the standing-for relation.  

      In their thesis of motor representation, knowing in preparation of motor actions
      is highlighted but the system&#8217;s doing when manipulating on-going motor
      activities is overlooked.  That &#8216;system&#8217;s doing&#8217;, however,
      retains an essential role in motor intentionality, a role which accounts for
      complexities of real environment, animate apparatus to be represented, and
      goal-oriented nature of motor movements.   

      Contrasted to Grush and Pezzulo&#8217;s thesis, my research highlights a
      pragmatic role of motor representation, pragmatic in sense of explaining how a
      motor agent can successfully achieve a goal by maintaining motor movements. 
      Internal models, in my account, not only supply emulation but serve to assist the
      motor system in its goal-achieving activities, resulting in efficient control and
      flexible movements.
