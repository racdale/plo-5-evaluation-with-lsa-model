	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined people&#8217;s ability to judge the degree of morality
      of good and bad actions, and their consistency in doing so. Participants judged
      the degree of morality of actions on a scale from +100 (moral) through 0
      (neither) to -100 (immoral).  They judged the degree of morality for individual
      actions e.g., &#8216;a man intervened to stop a fight&#8217;, &#8216;a man gave
      blood&#8217;, and their conjunction, &#8216;a man intervened to stop a fight and
      he gave blood&#8217;. Most judgments were consistent, i.e. the conjunction was
      judged to be more moral or immoral than its components. However, a reliable
      number of judgments were inconsistent, i.e. the conjunction was judged to be less
      moral or immoral than one or both of its components. Consistency improved when
      participants read the conjunction after the conjuncts, compared to when they read
      it before. We discuss implications for understanding the mental representation of
      degrees of morality.</p>
