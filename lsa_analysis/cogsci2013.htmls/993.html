	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the effects of strategy use and rule complexity on
      multivariable inductive judgments. Participants (N=274) made judgments about
      which of two cars presented on a computer screen was faster. Participants were
      randomly assigned to a complex rule or a simple rule. For the complex rule, three
      of five variables affected speed; for the simple rule one variable affected
      speed. Participants were instructed to make explicit (try to discover the rules
      governing speed) or implicit (speeded intuitive) judgments for 300 trials with
      feedback.

      A 2 (complexity) x 2 (strategy instruction) ANOVA revealed main effects of
      complexity, F(1,270)=6.17, p=.014, and task instruction, F(1,270)=11.69, p=.001,
      and a significant interaction, F(1,270)=7.38, p=.007. The explicit strategy led
      to better performance for the simple rule only, but no differences were found for
      the implicit strategy. These findings run counter to recent work showing an
      advantage for implicit processing of complex rules (Zimmerman & Pretz, 2012).</p>
