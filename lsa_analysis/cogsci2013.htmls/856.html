	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of this study was to examine cultural universality of the
      International Affective Picture System (IAPS) on a Russian sample (Lang et al,
      2008). One hundred subjects evaluated 300 IAPS pictures according to their
      valence, arousal and dominance.  Affective space determined by valence and
      arousal dimensions had a similar distribution to the American sample. There were
      significantly high correlations between North American and Russian ratings of
      valence, arousal and dominance.  Nevertheless comparison of these ratings showed
      that there are significant differences between North American and Russian
      valence, arousal and dominance scores. Such differences suggest cultural
      specificity &#1086;f situations which induce emotion and provide evidence of
      cultural factors effect on the affective experience.  Lastly, it shows the
      importance of using local cultural norms for internationally available stimuli in
      addition to the original stimuli, even in the study of such universal processes
      as an emotion. Supported by RFH Grant 12-06-12058.</p>
