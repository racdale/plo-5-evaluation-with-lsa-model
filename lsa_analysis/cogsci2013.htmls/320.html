	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>While social psychology has identified characteristics of
      intergroup dynamics, few studies have looked into the perceptions  of robot group
      dynamics.  In this experiment, we  separate robots into majority and  minority 
      groups based solely on their behavior in a simple dance routine.  We attempt to
      understand how people's perceptions of robots within those groups change based on
      group size and features of  behavior.  Participants viewed the robot dances and
      rated one robot from each group on a variety of characteristics. We find that
      being from the minority versus majority group  has a significant impact on
      perceptions of a robot's creativity, interestingness, anti-sociality, dancing
      ability, and how much of a team player it  is.  At the same time, individual
      behaviors (leading the dance, following the dance, or performing an entirely
      unique dance) have no statistical effect on participants' ratings of robot
      characteristics.  From these results, we conclude that group size has a larger
      effect than behavior on  subjective evaluations of robots in majority and
      minority groups.  </p>
