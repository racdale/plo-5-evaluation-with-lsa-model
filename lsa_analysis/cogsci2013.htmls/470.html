	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research has shown that spatial referencing differs across
      cultures. Whether &#8220;Western&#8221; samples, specifically ones speaking the
      same native language, show the same referencing patterns has not been
      investigated thus far. Examining spatial referencing behavior across different
      tasks, we compared samples from four different countries speaking the same
      language with respect to their application of the intrinsic frame of reference
      (FoR) and the three variants of the relative FoR. Our findings indicate
      influences of factors beyond language: While the four French-speaking samples
      showed an overall preference for the reflection variant of the relative FoR, they
      differed significantly regarding the extent to which reflection and the intrinsic
      FoR were applied. Moreover, in all samples, characteristics of the referenced
      objects, namely whether they were animate or inanimate, influenced FoR use. The
      order of tasks also had an impact on referencing behavior.</p>
