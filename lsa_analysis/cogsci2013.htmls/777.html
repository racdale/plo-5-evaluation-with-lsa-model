	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>ASD is diagnosed by perseverative behaviors and social deficits.
      While ASD children&#8217;s selective interest in the physical world may lead to
      more extensive exploration (and learning) of physical objects, they may learn
      less due to their perseverative behavior. How is exploration affected in children
      with ASD? We quantified exploration and discovery as children with ASD (N=35,
      M=8.5 yrs) and their controls (N=35, age, IQ matched) explored a novel toy with
      hidden functions. ASD children showed more perseveration than controls on every
      measure, and the diversity of their actions was negatively correlated with
      severity of autism. Furthermore, ASD children discovered less hidden functions
      than controls. While the control group showed a marked decrease in perseveration
      with age, ASD group showed a heightened level of perseveration independent of
      age. These data suggest that children with ASD show marked difference in their
      exploration of the physical environment, and this difference has real
      consequences for learning and discovery.</p>
