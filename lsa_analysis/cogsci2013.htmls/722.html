	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent studies show that visual search is often not well
      characterized as either a purely parallel or serial search strategy.
      Subsequently, the literature and computational models have evolved from
      traditional parallel and serial descriptions to a continuum of search efficiency.
      It has been demonstrated that search efficiency does not improve with
      simultaneous delivery of target features in a conjunction-search task.
      Interestingly, search efficiency does improve when non-linguistic visual delivery
      of target features appears incrementally and concurrently with the display onset,
      but not prior to display onset. In our current experiment, we explore the
      temporal constraints of the facilitatory effect found with concurrent incremental
      information processing. The results explain that linguistic and non-linguistic
      mediation of visual search, provided sufficient time to process, is chiefly due
      to the incrementality of target feature delivery when search has begun. This
      finding supports an interactive account of visual attention.</p>
