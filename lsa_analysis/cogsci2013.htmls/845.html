	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined whether skeptics hold implicit supernatural beliefs.
      In study 1, priming by reading a biological or a religious story about death had
      no effect on skeptics' afterlife beliefs. In study 2, participants indicated
      whether they would partake in a (bogus) scientific study that involved visiting a
      fortune teller and whether they would prefer a fortune teller who predicts
      positive and negative events or one who predicts only positive events. Believers
      chose the positive fortune teller more often than skeptics did. Study 3
      investigated whether participants' views about the afterlife, other paranormal
      phenomena, and ontological confusions differ in speeded and non-speeded response
      conditions. The results were moderated by thinking style: ontological confusions
      increased in speeded conditions for intuitive skeptics but not for reflective
      skeptics. The results indicate that skeptics don't hold implicit supernatural
      beliefs but intuitively thinking skeptics hold ontological confusions
      predisposing to supernatural beliefs. </p>
