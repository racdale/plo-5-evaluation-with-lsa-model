	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous work has identified a distributed, network of neural
      systems involved in appraising the value of rewards, such as when winning $100.
      We hypothesized that involvement of intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in this network is
      specialized for processing numeric rather than monetary value. To test our
      hypothesis, we manipulated numeric magnitude and units to construct a range of
      economic rewards (e.g., +$1, +100&#162;) in response to simple decisions.
      Consistent with our hypothesis, BOLD activity in IPS was related to changes in
      numeric magnitude, independent of monetary value, whereas activity in OFC was
      associated with monetary value, independent of numeric magnitude. Finally, by
      using representation similarity analysis, we found that the information
      represented in IPS and OFC was more consistent with the patterns expected if
      representations of numeric magnitudes or monetary values, respectively, were in a
      compressive scale. Together, these findings show the importance of numerical
      cognition for understanding how the brain processes monetary rewards.</p>
