	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research in relational learning suggests that simple training
      instances may lead to better generalization than complex training instances. We
      examined whether this &#8220;simple advantage&#8221; extends to category learning
      in adults with simplified and traditional (more complex) Chinese writing scripts.
      In Experiment 1, participants learned Chinese characters and their English
      translations, performed a memorization test, and were asked to generalize their
      learning to the corresponding characters written in the other script. In
      Experiment 2, we removed the training phase and modified the tests to examine
      transfer based purely on perceptual similarities between simplified and
      traditional characters. We found the simple advantage in both experiments.
      Training with simplified characters produced better generalization than training
      with traditional characters, both when generalization relied on recognition
      memory and on pure perceptual similarities. This finding advances our
      understanding of how features of a learning opportunity interact with
      domain-general learning mechanisms to prepare the mind for transfer.</p>
