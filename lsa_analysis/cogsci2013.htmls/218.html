	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In interpersonal interaction, the terms synchrony or alignment
      refer to the way in which communication channels like speech or body movement
      become intertwined over time, both across interlocutors and within a single
      individual. A recent trend in alignment research has targeted multimodal
      alignment, exploring how various communication channels affect one another over
      time (e.g., Louwerse et al., 2012). While existing research has made significant
      progress in mapping multimodal alignment during task-based or positively valenced
      interactions, little is known about the dynamics of multimodal alignment during
      conflict. We visualize multimodal alignment during naturalistic affiliative and
      argumentative interactions as networks based on analyses of body movement and
      speech. Broadly, we find that conversational contexts strongly impact the ways in
      which interlocutors&#8217; movement and speech systems self-organize
      interpersonally and intrapersonally.</p>
