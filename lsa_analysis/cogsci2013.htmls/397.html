	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>What information do people extract in the course of category
      learning? And how does training affect this process? The current study addressed
      these questions by examining the effects of training on the outcome of category
      learning in 4- to 5-year-olds and adults. In two experiments, participants were
      trained on either a classification task or an inference task and then tested with
      categorization and recognition tasks. The categorical information (i.e.,
      deterministic and probabilistic features) was explicitly given to participants in
      Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. Results with adults replicate previous
      findings indicating that participants form different representations in the
      course of classification and inference training (rule-based representation in the
      former case and similarity-based representations in the latter case).  In
      contrast, regardless of the type of training, young children form
      similarity-based representations. </p>
