	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In solving a variety of problems people interact with their
      external environment, often using artefacts to supplement and augment their
      problem solving skills. The role of interactivity in problem solving was
      investigated using a river-crossing problem. All participants performed the task
      twice, once in a high interactivity condition and once in a low interactivity
      condition. Moves to completion were higher in the high interactivity condition
      but latency per move was much shorter with high than with low interactivity.
      Moves in the world were easier to implement than to simulate mentally and acted
      as epistemic actions to facilitate thinking. In addition, when participants
      experienced the low interactivity version of the task second, their performance
      reflected little learning. However, when the high interactivity version was
      completed second, latency to solution and latency per move were substantially
      reduced. These results underscore the importance of investigating problem solving
      behaviour from a distributed cognition perspective.</p>
