	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We are poor lie detectors, with accuracy only marginally better
      than guessing. Raters in social situations such as these must battle with their
      own uncertainty if they are to make a judgment, yet lie detection research has
      given little attention to the effects of uncertainty. We present evidence
      suggesting prior knowledge and expectations have an early influence on the
      judgment process, but only when forced into judgment. If able to abstain, raters
      do not rely on prior knowledge but rather indicate their uncertainty by
      withholding judgment until all the available information has been presented.
      After the speaker has presented their statement, and when no additional new
      information is available, we provide evidence from a number of experiments that
      lie detectors integrate their pre-existing biases and experience about deception
      in general with more specific information about the statement at hand.</p>
