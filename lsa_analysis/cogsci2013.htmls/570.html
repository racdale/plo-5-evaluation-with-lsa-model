	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In his seminal dissertation, Henson (1996) identified a number of
      constraints on theories of serial order memory. Two constraints, the fill-in
      constraint, in which an item that is erroneously recalled early is likely to be
      followed by its predecessor rather than its successor (recall of ACB is more
      likely than ACD), and the protrusion constraint, in which prior list intrusions
      are likely to be recalled in the same output position as their previous serial
      position, were considered evidence against chaining theories. We present results
      from two experiments which investigate the extent to which these effects are
      dependent on experimental methodology. When participants are given an open set of
      items, an equal ratio of fill-in and in-fill errors was observed and a protrusion
      effect was obtained. However, when a reconstruction of order task was used, a
      fill-in effect was observed. Implications for theories of serial order memory are
      discussed.</p>
