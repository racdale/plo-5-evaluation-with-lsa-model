	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Combinatoriality---the recombination of a small set of basic forms
      to create an infinite number of meaningful units---has long been seen as a core
      design feature of language, but its origins remain uncertain. Two hypotheses have
      been suggested. The first is that combinatoriality is a necessary solution to the
      problem of conveying a large number of meanings; the sec- ond is that it arises
      as a consequence of conventionalisation. We tested these hypotheses in an
      experimental-semiotics study. Our results supported the hypothesis based on
      conventionali- sation but offered little support for the hypothesis based on the
      number of meanings.</p>
