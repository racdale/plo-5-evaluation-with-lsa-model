	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It has been suggested that a referent&#8217;s accessibility is
      affected by the degree to which it is in the speaker&#8217;s attention. Assuming
      that less accessible referents are less likely to be pronominalized, this
      predicts that speakers under cognitive load use more elaborate referring
      expressions. However, speakers under load may also have difficulty taking into
      account their addressee&#8217;s perspective, which may either lead to more use of
      the speaker&#8217;s own discourse model or to more economic expressions. To tease
      these effects apart, we conducted a story completion experiment in which
      cognitive load was manipulated by the presence or absence of a secondary task for
      the speaker. In addition, we dissociated the speaker&#8217;s and the
      addressee&#8217;s perspectives. Our results do not provide evidence for the
      hypothesis that cognitive load reduces the accessibility of referents in the
      speaker&#8217;s own discourse model, suggesting that speaker attention does not
      determine accessibility.</p>
