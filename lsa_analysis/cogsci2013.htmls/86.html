	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cerebral lateralization is intertwined with virtually every
      cognitive function that we think makes us human. Yet a clear dichotomy has never
      been explained: lateralized processing suggests independent, local development of
      neural circuits, but the complementary nature of lateralized functions and
      extremely strong functional coupling between homologous areas suggest robust
      interhemispheric interactions. Here, we review literature and present modeling
      evidence that this dichotomy can be explained by the uniquely steep trajectory of
      human post-natal brain growth. This drastic volumetric change cause most long
      distance, interhemispheric connections to be more unreliable than shorter,
      intrahemispheric connections, leading to lateralization. Strong interhemispheric
      collaboration is enabled by the later maturation and myelination of long-distance
      callosal connections. We also review and reanalyze a well-cited modeling paper
      (Ringo, Doty, Demeter, & Simard, 1994) thought to show a relationship between the
      degree of hemispheric coordination and length of conduction delays, showing that
      previous claims have a clear alternative explanation.</p>
