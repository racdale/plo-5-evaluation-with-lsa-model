	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The results from a number of recent studies suggest that
      ascriptions of intentionality are based on evaluative considerations:
      specifically, that the likelihood of viewing a person&#8217;s actions as
      intentional is greater when the outcome is bad than good (see Knobe, 2006, 2010).
      In this research we provide an alternative explanation for these findings, one
      based on the idea that ascriptions of intentionality depend on causal structure.
      As predicted by the causal structure view, we observed that actions leading to
      bad outcomes are associated with negative social pressures (Experiment 1), that
      these negative pressures give rise to a specific kind of causal structure
      (Experiment 2), and that when these causal structures are pitted against the
      badness of the outcome, intentionality judgments track with causal structure and
      not badness (Experiment 3). While the badness of an outcome may have an indirect
      effect on judgments of intentionality, our results suggest that the factors that
      affect judgments of intentionality most directly are non-evaluative and
      objective.</p>
