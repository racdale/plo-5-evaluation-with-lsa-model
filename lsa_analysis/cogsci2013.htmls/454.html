	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Listeners normally provide speakers with simultaneous feedback
      such as nods, "yeah"s and "mhm"s. These`backchannels' are important in helping
      speakers to talk effectively. Two factors are known to influence when a
      backchannel is produced; if the speaker is looking at the listener or if the
      speaker is presenting new information. We investigate a third factor: whether the
      speaker is having trouble speaking i.e. self-repair. If dialogue is an active
      collaborative process then listener's responses should be especially critical
      when trouble is encountered. Using data from a corpus of three person dialogues
      we show that speaker's rate of self-repair is a better predictor of listener
      responses than speech rate. We also show that listeners respond strongly to
      speaker troubles independently of whether the speaker is looking at them.
      We argue that it is the points at which conversation threatens to go off-course
      that are most significant for coordination.</p>
