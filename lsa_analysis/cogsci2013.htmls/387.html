	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How is musical memory organized? While classic studies of music
      perception appealed to schematic or symbolic knowledge structures, recent work
      suggests that listeners form highly-detailed auditory representations of music.
      Studies of metrical restoration&#8212;memory fill-in of the &#8220;beat&#8221; of
      a metrically-ambiguous melody&#8212;suggest some organizing dimensions in musical
      memory. However, many potential dimensions remain unexplored. The current study
      looked for effects of mode (major vs. minor)&#8212;a substantial organizing force
      in Western music&#8212;and timbre (what instrument is playing) on metrical
      restoration. Both mode and timbre can signify particular musical styles. In
      Experiment 1, listeners showed timbre specificity in metrical restoration, but
      not mode specificity. However, in Experiment 2, when timbres were extremely
      unique (one per melody), restoration effects were not observed, suggesting that
      too much variability leads to diffuse representations which are too weak to
      support metrical restoration. Implications for the nature of musical memory are
      discussed.</p>
