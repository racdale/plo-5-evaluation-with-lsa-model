	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In novel situations, learning is biased towards information that
      has a degree of prior predictive utility. In human learning, this is termed the
      learned predictiveness effect and has proved critical in theorising about the
      role of attention in learning. Two experiments are reported in which the relative
      contribution of controlled and automatic processes to learned predictiveness are
      investigated. Experiment 1 showed that while learned predictiveness is
      susceptible to instructional manipulation, this effect is partial. Experiment 2
      manipulated predictive utility and instruction orthogonally in order to test the
      potential involvement of automatic processes. It was found that even when cues
      were explicitly instructed as causal, learning was biased in favour of previously
      predictive over previously non-predictive cues. Interestingly, this was reversed
      for cues instructed as irrelevant. This suggests that learned predictiveness
      benefits attentional control, whereby information is both easier to attend and
      ignore.</p>
