	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) was devised to measure the
      inhibition of heuristic responses to favour analytic ones. Toplak, West and
      Stanovich (2011) demonstrated that the CRT was a powerful predictor of heuristics
      and biases task performance - proposing it as a metric of the cognitive
      miserliness central to dual process theories of thinking. This thesis was
      examined using reasoning response-times, normative responses from two reasoning
      tasks and working memory capacity (WMC)  to predict individual differences in
      performance on the CRT. These data offered limited support for the view of
      miserliness as the primary factor in the CRT. The strongest predictor of CRT in
      both experiments was WMC. It is argued that while cognitive miserliness has been
      implicated in CRT performance, participants must also possess the requisite WMC
      and mindware to successfully complete it. Therefore, the psychological and
      psychometric properties of the CRT require continued study.</p>
