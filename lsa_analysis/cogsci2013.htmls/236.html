	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The relationship between individual cognition and cultural
      phenomena at the society level can be transformed by cultural transmission
      (Kirby, Dowman, & Griffiths, 2007). Top-down models of this process have
      typically assumed that individuals only adopt a single linguistic trait. Recent
      extensions include &#8216;bilingual&#8217; agents, able to adopt multiple
      linguistic traits (Burkett & Griffiths, 2010). However, bilingualism is more than
      variation within an individual: it involves the conditional use of variation with
      different interlocutors. That is, bilingualism is a property of a population that
      emerges from use. A bottom-up simulation is presented where learners are
      sensitive to the identity of other speakers. The simulation reveals that dynamic
      social structures are a key factor for the evolution of bilingualism in a
      population, a feature that was abstracted away in the top-down models. Top-down
      and bottom-up approaches may lead to different answers, but can work together to
      reveal and explore important features of the cultural transmission process.</p>
