	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recently, researchers in usage-based linguistics have argued that
      language should be thought of as a domain-general processing faculty operating on
      rich memory representations of particular experiences with language. If true,
      this would imply that context-dependent memory effects ought to be detectable
      across the language-nonlanguage boundary. Specifically, it would imply that that
      by manipulating nonlinguistic environmental context, it should be possible to
      influence people's linguistic production. This study reports three experiments
      testing whether environmental background color, music, or sound can influence
      participants' choice of active or passive voice in a picture-description task.
      Results suggest that the effect, if present, is not as clear-cut as has been
      argued by some language theorists, but there are promising signs that language
      production may indeed be susceptible to associative influence from the
      nonlinguistic environment. </p>
