	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Eye gaze and behavioral mimicry are important foundations of
      social interaction. Inspired by recent studies on eye-gaze me- diated spontaneous
      behavioral mimicry of gestures, we studied the effect of eye gaze direction on
      vocal mimicry. Participants were instructed to repeat digits spoken by a virtual
      agent with a direct or averted eye gaze. As a measure of imitation, the vocal
      pitch was recorded and analyzed in order to determine if and to what extent vocal
      mimicry was modulated by eye gaze. The results showed that eye gaze direction
      affects vocal mimicry as measured by pitch slope. That is, when partici- pants
      were exposed to an agent that gazed at them directly, they accommodated their
      intonation more to that of the agent, than when they were exposed to an agent
      that averted its gaze. These results suggest that in social interaction with a
      virtual agent, humans mimic vocal intonation and that the degree of mimicry
      depends on the eye-gaze direction of the agent. The implications for studies of
      social interaction are discussed.</p>
