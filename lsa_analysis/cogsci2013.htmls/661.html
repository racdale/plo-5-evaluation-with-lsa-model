	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Extensive research effort has been invested in building
      neurocomputational models for face and object recognition. However, the
      relationship between the recognition model and the development of the visual
      system is rarely considered. Research on the development of contrast sensitivity
      shows that human infants can only perceive low spatial frequency information from
      visual stimuli, but their acuity improves gradually with age. Also, the right
      hemisphere (RH) develops earlier than the left hemisphere (LH), and is dominant
      in infants. Here we show that these constraints, coupled with a desire on the
      part of the infant to individuate its caretakers and family, leads naturally to
      the right hemisphere bias for face processing. We propose a developmental model
      for face and object recognition using a modular neural network based on Dailey
      and Cottrell (1999). This neural network represents the two hemispheres using two
      modules, with a competitive relationship between them mediated by a gating
      mechanism. The strong RH and low spatial frequency bias for face recognition
      emerges naturally in the model from the interaction of the slow development of
      acuity and the early dominance of the right hemisphere. Remarkably, this strong
      asymmetry does not appear to hold for the other object categories that we
      tried.</p>
