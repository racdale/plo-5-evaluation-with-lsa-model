	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The &#8220;Spatial Arrangement Method&#8221; (SpAM) has gained
      popularity for measuring similarity judgments (Perry, Cook, & Samuelson, 2011;
      Hout, Goldinger, & Ferguson, 2012; Kriegeskorte, 2012). In SpAM, multiple stimuli
      are freely arranged in two dimensions such that more similar stimuli are close
      together. We performed two SpAM experiments to investigate the process by which
      participants make multiple simultaneous similarity judgments using novel stimuli.
      The experiments differed across either two or three feature dimensions. Mouse and
      Eye-tracking measures, as well as the sequence of stimuli placed, provided a rich
      picture of participants&#8217; decision processes as they made these judgments.
      Both experiments revealed strong effects of group context. Clustered presentation
      of stimuli by feature influenced both the order and the timing of placements, and
      despite equal metric spacing of stimuli along each dimension, participants
      typically warped placements along dimensions nonlinearly. We discuss implications
      of these findings for theories and models of similarity. </p>
