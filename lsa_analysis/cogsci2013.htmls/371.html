	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined the role of spatial representations and word order on
      thematic role assignment in Greek. Previous studies suggest that spatial
      representations influence thematic role assignment; agent is typically depicted
      on the left, and patient on the right. Here, we address this issue using a
      language with flexible word order which allows us to manipulate sentence
      structure (SVO&#8211;OVS) orthogonally to thematic role. Greek speakers heard
      SVO/OVS sentences while viewing depictions of actions involving two characters
      and they judged whether sentence and picture matched in meaning. The
      agent&#8217;s position in the picture was directly manipulated. The results
      support the effect of left bias on language processing. However, this bias may be
      better understood when its interaction with other sources of information and
      language-specific constraints are taken into account. Theories of prediction may
      help us illuminate how spatial biases and linguistic factors interactively affect
      the way we process our world.</p>
