	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Here we explore the possibility that the speed of learning is
      affected by the precision of our sensory estimates for the learned
      category&#8217;s diagnostic feature dimensions. Colour information from a
      foveated stimulus, if represented as a sample on a metric colour dimension,
      should faithfully represent differences in the shapes and precision of the
      estimates as a consequence of the sample size. Differences in the sample
      variability are expected to have affect on exactly what gets associated during
      learning. We provide evidence that a manipulation in sub-fovea feature size,
      0.18&#176; vs 1.19&#176; of visual angle, influences learning speed. In both
      conditions the simple colour features are easy to see and we do not detect any
      gaze differences as measured by total fixation durations and individual feature
      fixation durations. Learning methods that metrically represent activity on
      feature dimensions such as Dynamic Field Theory (DFT) may be able to account for
      this data.</p>
