	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research has examined the use of graphical overviews as a
      way to structure students&#8217; self-regulated, online learning. Although
      findings have suggested that graphical overviews can improve learning from online
      content, there has been little direct evidence as to why this benefit may occur.
      In this research, eye tracking and verbal protocols were gathered as 26
      pre-service teachers used a graphical overview or keyword interface to choose
      online resources for an educational task. Fixation times and pupil diameter were
      analyzed as measures of cognitive effort; results demonstrated that pupil
      diameter was significantly lower when participants used the graphical as compared
      to the keyword interface. Protocol analysis was used to examine the depth of
      processing during search and evaluation; results showed that participants using
      the graphical overview engaged in deeper analysis of domain content. Results
      provide evidence for the importance of graphically-based cognitive offloading
      during &#8220;searching to learn&#8221; tasks. </p>
