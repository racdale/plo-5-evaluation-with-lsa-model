	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>One of the more challenging research areas in cognitive science is
      the attempt to understand how the brain supports consciousness. This historically
      philosophical endeavor is now actively studied in the sciences, with research on
      visual attention being an especially promising area that can further our
      understanding of consciousness. A major problem with this cross-disciplinary
      pursuit, however, is that for philosophers and scientists, the terms
      consciousness, attention, and conscious attention are ambiguous and used
      differently even by those within the same academic discipline. The goal of this
      paper is to begin laying the groundwork for a unified study of consciousness by
      delineating common terminology for attention and consciousness and by identifying
      the relationship between the two within the study of conscious attention. This
      includes categorizing current theories according to a spectrum of theoretical
      complexity.</p>
