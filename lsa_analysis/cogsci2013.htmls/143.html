	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Syntactic constructions roughly correspond to sentence meanings.
      Previous research has shown that Chinese children can associate an SVO
      construction with a causative event at age 2, but do not always map an SV
      construction to a non-causative event even after reaching 5 years of age. The
      latter results may be attributed to the fact that Chinese allows
      argument-dropping (Jiang & Haryu, 2010). This paper investigated Chinese
      adults&#8217; syntax-semantics knowledge and found that even adults do not always
      map an intransitive construction to a non-causative event, although they are
      likely to use an intransitive construction to describe a non-causative event. The
      results suggest that although Chinese adults understand that causative and
      non-causative events should typically be described using transitive and
      intransitive constructions, respectively, the use of this knowledge in inferring
      novel verb meanings seems to be regulated by the actual usage of SV sentences in
      Chinese.</p>
