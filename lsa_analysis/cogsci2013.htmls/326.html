	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Prominent theories of decision making, such as {\it proportional
      difference model}, {\it priority heuristics}, {\it decision field theory} and
      {\it regret theory} assume that people do not evaluate options independently of
      each other. Instead, these theories predict that people compare the options'
      outcomes with each other. Therefore the theories' predictions strongly depend on
      the association between outcomes. In the present work, we examine how the
      association between options can be best described. For options with two outcomes
      the standard correlation measure between option's outcomes does not provide a
      meaningful interpretation. Therefore, we propose the standardized covariance
      between options A and B, denoted as $\sigma^*_{AB}$. We describe the properties
      and interpretation of this measurement and show its similarities and differences
      with the correlation measurement. Finally, we show how the predictions of
      different models of decision making vary depending on the value of the
      standardized covariance.</p>
