	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Abstract: This study compared 4th grade children in the U.S. and
      Taiwan on understanding (linearity, area, and volume. Taiwanese and American
      children were both under 50% correct for the concepts of area and volume in
      October. By May, Taiwanese children learned 90% of the targeted concepts.
      American children were still under 50% correct.

      During the following year, U.S. children received five weeks of instruction on
      linear, square, and cubic measure, or they received no instruction. Results
      showed significant increases on accurate knowledge of all measurement concepts,
      average score = 89%. Improvement was related, at the .72 level, to memory for
      forward going digit span. The control group did not improve on any type of
      measurement concept, despite their similar scores on memory for digit span. A
      third study showed that repeated practice on multiplication lowered the effects
      that digit span memory has on learning measurement concepts.
