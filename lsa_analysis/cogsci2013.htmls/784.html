	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Children's conception of lies has been important issues for
      children's cognitive development. However, little is known about whether
      children's understanding of lies is different form adults' one. Four kinds of
      stories were presented for children aged 6- to 7- year olds and undergraduate
      students. First, a protagonist had a deceptive intention and produced a false
      statement. Second, he had a deceptive intention but produced a true statement by
      a false belief. Third, he had a truthful intention and produced a true statement.
      Fourth, he had a truthful intention but produced a false statement by a false
      belief. The results showed that undergraduate students judged that these
      protagonist's statements were lying or not by considering his intentions. By
      contrast, children judged regardless of his intentions. These results suggest
      that children's conception of lying is different from adults' one, and that their
      conception becomes sophisticated after middle childhood.</p>
