	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In learned helplessness experiments, subjects first experience a
      lack of control
      in one situation, and then show learning deficits when performing or learning
      another task in another situation. Generalization, thus, is at the core of the
      learned helplessness phenomenon. Substantial experimental and theoretical effort
      has been invested into establishing that a state- and
      task-independent belief about controllability is necessary. However, to what
      extent generalization is also sufficient to explain the transfer has not been
      examined. Here, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that Bayesian learning
      of action-outcome contingencies at three levels of abstraction is sufficient to
      account for the key features of learned helplessness, including escape deficits
      and impairment of appetitive learning after inescapable shocks.</p>
