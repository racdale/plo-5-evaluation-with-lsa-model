	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A high degree of self-disclosure in Online Social Networks (OSNs)
      is associated with several risks. This raises an important question: Why
      don&#180;t many users protect their personal data more eagerly? We propose that a
      lack of memory for what information has been disclosed to which audience
      contributes to this privacy-neglecting behavior in OSNs. We transferred the
      paradigm of target monitoring to a fictitious OSN and varied the degree of risk
      associated with self-disclosure. In a 2x2 experiment we varied both audience size
      (large vs. small) and information intimacy (personal vs. non-personal). We used
      recognition tests for the association of audience and disclosed information to
      assess memory performance. Results show that item memory (the memory for what
      information has been disclosed) exceeded target memory and that target memory
      improved in vulnerable situations (for large audiences and personal information).
      Our findings widen the realm of offline memory research and expand our knowledge
      about which cognitive factors impact privacy-related behavior in online
      environments.</p>
