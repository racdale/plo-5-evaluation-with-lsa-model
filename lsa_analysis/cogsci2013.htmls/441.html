	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Maintaining focused attention in the classroom is considered an
      important factor for successful learning. Loss of instructional time due to
      off-task behavior is recognized as a significant challenge by both researchers
      and practitioners. However, there has been little research into the factors
      contributing to off-task behavior. This paper reports results from the first
      large-scale study investigating how elementary school children allocate their
      attention in classroom environments and how patterns of attention allocation
      change as a function of gender, grade level, and instructional format. The
      findings indicate that instructional format is related to off-task behavior in
      elementary school students. These findings can begin to form a foundation for
      development of research-based guidelines for instructional design aimed to
      optimize focused attention in classroom settings. </p>
