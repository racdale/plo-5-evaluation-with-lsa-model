	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>What psychological and linguistic processes allow one to go beyond
      the literal meaning of a sentence and infer what was meant but not said
      (&#8220;reading between the lines&#8221;)? Theorists have differed as to whether
      these phenomena are driven by complex, online inference processes or by
      relatively rote rules. The present study uses ERP to explore the cognitive and
      neural mechanisms involved in scalar implicature (the inference that, e.g.,
      &#8220;some&#8221; indicates &#8220;some but not all&#8221;), a test case that
      has been subject to considerable behavioral research but limited
      neuropsychological research. Our results challenge both rote-processing and
      rich-inference accounts. We provide the first ERP results showing that scalar
      implicature processing depends on context, challenging rote-processing theories
      of implicature. However, we also fail to find evidence of a processing cost
      associated with implicature processing, as predicted by many rich-inference
      accounts. These results point to a novel conceptualization of pragmatic
      processing in scalar implicature.</p>
