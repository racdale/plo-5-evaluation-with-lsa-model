	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We asked college students to make judgments about realistic moral
      situations presented as dilemmas (which asked for an either/or decision) vs.
      problems (which did not ask for such a decision) as well as when the situation
      explicitly included affectively salient language vs. non-affectively salient
      language. We report two main findings. The first is that there are four different
      types of cognitive strategy that subjects use in their responses: simple
      reasoning, intuitive judging, cautious reasoning, and empathic reasoning. We give
      operational definitions of these types in terms of our observed data. In
      addition, the four types characterized strategies not only in the whole sample,
      but also in all of the subsamples in our study. The second finding is that the
      intuitive judging type comprised approximately 26% of our respondents, while
      about 74% of our respondents employed one of the three styles of reasoning named
      above. We think that these findings present an interesting challenge to models of
      moral cognition which predict that there is either a single, or a single most
      common, strategy &#8211; especially a strategy of relying upon one&#8217;s
      intuitions &#8211; that people use to think about moral situations. </p>
