	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many moral psychologists have proposed that the difference between
      people&#8217;s moral judgments about the Trolley and Footbridge dilemmas can be
      explained by their differing emotional responses to the dilemmas. In two
      experiments, we tested this explanation by presenting the dilemmas and measuring
      participants&#8217; reactions using a self-report emotion measure (PANAS-X). As
      might be expected, participants experienced more intense emotions after reading
      moral dilemmas when compared to a non-moral dilemma. However, participants&#8217;
      emotional reactions to the Trolley and Footbridge dilemmas did not differ. Our
      findings call the oft cited emotion explanation into question.</p>
