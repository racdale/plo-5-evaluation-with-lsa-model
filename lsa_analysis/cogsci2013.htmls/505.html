	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Utilizing a Preparation for Future Learning paradigm and the
      Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive framework, this study examined how two
      different kinds of cognitively engaging activities prepared students to learn
      from collaborating. Findings show that preparing prior to collaborating improved
      learning, but a difference was not detected in the type of preparation. In
      addition, differences in learning outcomes were only present in measures of deep
      knowledge. Analyses used a multilevel method targeted to dyadic data. Discussion
      addresses designing collaborative classroom activities that are effective and
      efficient for deep learning, as well as the importance of aligning assessments to
      depth of learning.</p>
