	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>From the moment they make up their mind, people are reluctant to
      change it. We tested the hypothesis that people disposing of more cognitive
      resources&#8212;through circadian variations or socially distributed
      thinking&#8212;would engage in deliberative thinking and would consequently be
      less likely to exhibit belief perseverance. Perseverance was measured by the
      change in judgments related to a suspect in a criminal case, following the
      presentation of an offender profile that was at odds with the suspect&#8217;s
      description. Individuals tested at a compatible circadian time exhibited less
      perseverance in the face of contradictory evidence compared to individuals tested
      at an incongruent time. Individuals deliberating on their own also tended to show
      more belief perseverance compared to those who worked in groups. There was,
      however, no interaction effect between circadian timing and condition of
      deliberation on belief change. The implications for our understanding of the
      mechanisms that underpin belief perseverance are discussed.</p>
