	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When people judge whether others are telling the truth, they act
      differently if they are working alone or in a group. The current experiment
      explored this finding. Participants (working alone or in pairs) provided either a
      binary truth/lie decision, or a binary decision and a set of reasons chosen from
      a list, or an open ended discussion/explanation. Being alone or in a pair had no
      significant effect on accuracy, but confidence was higher in pairs. A truth bias
      was found in the single condition but was eliminated for pairs when they
      specified a reason or had a discussion. Accuracy was highest when stating a
      reason chosen from a list, while confidence increased with the amount of
      information provided. These findings improve our understanding of the effect of
      pair decision making, illustrating how varying levels of information can have
      different effect on decision making and deception detection.</p>
