	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of the present study was to determine the differential
      contributions of the action observation network (AON) and the social neural
      network (SNN) to the experience of naturalness in observed dyadic social
      interactions. To this end, we used short animation sequences displaying social
      interactions between two virtual characters and systematically manipulated
      kinematic features of the social dynamics. A group of 21 male participants rated
      the &#8220;naturalness&#8221; of the observed scenes on a four-point scale while
      undergoing fMRI. Using the ratings of each participant as a parametric modulation
      of their general neural response to the stimuli, we found that an increase in
      naturalness experience was associated with higher activations in the AON. The SNN
      was preferentially recruited with a decrease in naturalness experience. This
      indicates that understanding familiar interactions involves an automatic
      kinematic processing of intentionality, while interactions perceived as
      artificial require higher-level inferential processing.</p>
