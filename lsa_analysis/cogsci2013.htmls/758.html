	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract> Anomalous aspects of speech and voice, including pitch, fluency,
      and voice quality, are reported to characterize many mental disorders. However,
      it has proven difficult to quantify and explain this oddness of speech by
      employing traditional statistics methods.

      In this study we employ Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to investigate
      the temporal dynamics of voice in three mental disorders. We elicited monological
      descriptions of short videos in patients with schizophrenia, depression and
      Asperger's, as well as in related matched controls. We applied RQA to fundamental
      frequency, speech pause sequences and speech rate. The Rqa indexes (trend and
      entropy in particular) enable us to quantify and automatically discriminate
      between populations with &gt;85% of accuracy, highlighting distinctive voice
      dynamics in each diagnoses. </p>
