	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Second language learners&#8217; construction of their syntactic
      representation is greatly influenced by their L1 characteristics and the input of
      their L2. Although it is known that the more universal a pattern is, the easier
      it will transfer to facilitate the formation of the representation, the role of
      markedness on such representation remains unclear. The current study tested two
      groups of Mandarin L2 learners, i.e., native speakers of English and Japanese
      with three levels of proficiency using the four structures in Mandarin: SVO, ba
      OV, S ba O V, and topicalization with novel verbs and neutral animacy cues in a
      forced choice paradigm to investigate what role of markedness plays in such
      representations. The results indicated that in addition to the initial transfer
      for the syntactic representation that is affected by learners&#8217; L1 cue
      validity, the degree of markedness exerts impact on learners&#8217; rate of
      acquisition of syntax at different levels.</p>
