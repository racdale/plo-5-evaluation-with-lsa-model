	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper, we empirically investigate whether people
      understand irony from computers in order to test the recent argument for an
      egocentric tendency in irony comprehension. In the experiment, participants took
      a timed math test comprising 10 questions of 3-digit by 2-digit multiplication.
      After that, they received a feedback comment on their performance (including
      potentially ironic sentences) from either an intelligent evaluation system with
      an AI engine (AI condition), a nonintelligent automatic evaluation system (Auto
      condition), or a
      human judge connected via the network (Human condition). The result was that the
      participants in the AI and Auto conditions understood the comment as ironic as
      those in the Human condition, and the participants in the AI condition perceived
      more sarcasm than other participants. Because people know that computers cannot
      think just as humans do, these results can be regarded as evidence for the
      egocentric tendency in irony comprehension, indicating that participants
      understood irony egocentrically fromtheir own perspective without taking into
      account the mental state of the ironic speaker. These findings are also
      consistent with the &#8220;media equation&#8221; theory, from which we can
      suggest implications for the media equation, anthropomorphism, and
      computer-mediated communication of irony.</p>
