	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In order to learn about the world, young children rely on
      information provided by social partners. Past research has shown children
      consider a variety of factors when learning from others, including consensus.
      Corriveau, Fusaro, and Harris (2009) found that in an object labeling task,
      children trust responses that receive majority support, and they concluded that
      children prefer members of a majority as social informants. However, it is
      possible that children prefer majority members only in domains that rely strongly
      on socially constructed norms, such as object labeling, where non-social
      information is unavailable. We formalized this prediction using a rational model
      of learning from testimony across tasks, and compared our model&#8217;s
      predictions to children&#8217;s responses in object labeling and causal learning
      tasks. We find that in a causal learning task, a domain that relies less on
      socially constructed norms, children rely more on their personal observations
      than informant testimony.</p>
