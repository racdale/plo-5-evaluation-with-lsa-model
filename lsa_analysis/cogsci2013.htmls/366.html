	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research on how information should be presented during inductive
      category learning has identified both interleaving of categories and blocking by
      category as beneficial for learning. Previous work suggests that this mixed
      evidence can be reconciled by taking into account within- and between- category
      similarity relations. In this paper we present a new moderating factor. One group
      of participants studied categories actively, either interleaved or blocked.
      Another group studied the same categories passively. Results from a subsequent
      generalization task show that active learning benefits from interleaved
      presentation while passive learning benefits from blocked presentation.</p>
