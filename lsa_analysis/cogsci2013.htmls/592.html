	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study evaluates how people represent &#8220;even if&#8221;
      conditionals when they have to integrate them with previous &#8220;if then&#8221;
      conditionals and also make an inference. The terms in the premises were ordered
      to facilitate their integration (Figure 1: If A then B; Even if B C). In half the
      cases, the &#8220;even if&#8221; conditional was expressed with a negation
      instead of an affirmation (If A then B; Even if not B C). Participants had to
      infer what followed, given A or C. Previous results showed that in comprehension
      tasks, where information had to be integrated, counterfactual conditionals seemed
      to be represented with just one situation (B and C). By contrast, when people had
      to make inferences with these conditionals, they seemed to represent two
      situations. In any case, counterfactual seem to be represented with two
      situations (B and C, and not B and C). In our task, people had to do both: to
      infer and to integrate. Results showed that the use of negations and the
      direction in the inference had an effect on the endorsed inferences, but the two
      factors did not interact. The need to integrate premises did not block access to
      the two &#8220;even if&#8221; situations in an inference task
