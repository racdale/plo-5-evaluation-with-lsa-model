	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Beliefs frequently undergo revisions, especially when new pieces
      of information are true but inconsistent with current beliefs. In previous
      studies, we showed that spatial belief revision is often guided by the functional
      asymmetry between the reference object and the located objects of the spatial
      relation. Here we first draw a connection between spatial belief revision and
      grounded cognition. In two experiments, we explored whether imagined physical
      properties of objects influence which object is relocated and which remains at
      its initial position. Participants mentally revised beliefs about the arrangement
      of objects which could be envisaged as small and large (Experiment 1) or easy to
      move and difficult to move (Experiment 2). The results show that (1) small
      objects are more often relocated than larger objects and (2) easy to move objects
      are faster relocated than difficult to move objects. The findings are in line
      with the idea of grounded cognition.</p>
