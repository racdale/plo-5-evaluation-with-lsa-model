	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Humans are uniquely good at inventing norms, thinking about norms,
      complying with norms and defeating norms. It is small wonder, then, that norms
      are a focus of much interest as well as debate across the cognitive sciences,
      encompassing such diverse issues as rationality, morality and action. The aim of
      the present symposium is to bring together a range of psychological and
      philosophical contributions to this pertinent debate. Contributors come from
      diverse backgrounds, including epistemology, meta-ethics, moral judgment,
      decision making, and reasoning. We will examine foundational issues in normative
      thinking, such as: What is the relation between norms and descriptions? What are
      the psychological mechanisms underlying normative thinking? How do epistemic and
      moral norms guide action? What, if any, are the appropriate norms for knowledge,
      rationality, and moral behaviour, and how can they be determined?</p>
