	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The click-detection paradigm was employed to probe the load
      exerted by the parser within simple Spanish sentences. In Experiment 1, three
      positions at the beginning of clauses were established and results suggest that
      Ss are better prepared the deeper into a sentence the click is. Experiment 2 ran
      an ERP experiment to determine whether these RTs were the result of the
      &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; Ss may have felt regarding the click position, the idea
      being that the amplitude of the P300 would correlate with the click positions. In
      Experiment 3, click positions were moved to the end of clauses to establish if
      the end of a sentence results in a specific strain on working memory. RTs show
      that Ss are slower in the first position but the measures even out after that,
      with the possibility that Ss may have attempted to &#8220;wrap it up&#8221; in
      both the second and the third positions.</p>
