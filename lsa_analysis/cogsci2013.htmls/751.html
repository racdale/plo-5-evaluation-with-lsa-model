	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The interactivity framework (Chi, 2009) proposes learners
      experience greater learning benefits as they become more generative with learning
      material. This research investigated the active-constructive-interactive
      framework in the context of graphical organizers before a self-regulated, online
      learning task. Graphical displays were node-link diagrams, where nodes identified
      important domain concepts and link labels described the relationship between
      concepts. Conditions examined: passive (in which nodes and links were provided);
      active (in which nodes were provided and learners revealed link labels on
      demand); and constructive (in which nodes were provided and learners generated
      link labels). Findings were consistent with the interactivity framework for
      constructive learners, who integrated more concepts into posttest concept maps
      and included more deep (relational/causal) statements in their posttest essays.
      However, there were no significant differences for passive and active conditions.
      Results demonstrate that constructive activities may be necessary to support
      deeper learning outcomes in activities used before self-directed learning
      tasks.</p>
