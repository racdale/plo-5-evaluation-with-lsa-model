	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Richardson, Spivey and Hoover (2009) observed that attending to
      one of two choices in a decision making task increases the likelihood of that
      response by ten percent. Reflexive gaze orientation, attending to the same area
      as others, has also been shown to influence reaction times on simple dual choice
      tasks. The current study addressed how the eye gaze direction of a highly
      simplified face influences decisions made regarding questions with no obvious
      answer. Observed results indicate that the appearance of eyes looking toward one
      answer over another significantly impacts the decision making process. Similar to
      past work on the impact of social stimuli on orienting, we show that social
      stimuli can also impact decision making under uncertainty.</p>
