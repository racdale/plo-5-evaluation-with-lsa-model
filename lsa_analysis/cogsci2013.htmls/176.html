	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The detection and categorization of animate motions is a crucial
      task underlying social interaction and perceptual decision-making. Neural
      representations of perceived animate objects are built in the primate cortical
      region STS which is a region of convergent input from intermediate level form and
      motion representations. Populations of STS cells exist which are selectively
      responsive to specific animated motion sequences. It is still unclear how and to
      which extent form and motion information contribute to the generation of such
      representations and what kind of mechanisms are involved in the learning
      processes. We demonstrate how the proposed model automatically selects
      significant motion patterns as well as meaningful static form prototypes.
      Sequence selective representations are learned in STS by fusing static form and
      motion input from the segregated bottom-up driving input streams. Cells in STS,
      in turn, feed activities recurrently to their input sites along top-down signal
      pathways, enabling predictions about future input.</p>
