	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Researchers since at least Darwin have debated whether and to what
      extent emotions are universal or culture-dependent. However, previous studies
      have primarily focused on facial expressions and on a limited set of emotions.
      Given that emotions have a substantial impact on human lives, evidence for
      cultural emotional relativity might be derived by applying distributional
      semantics techniques to a text corpus of self-reported behaviour. Here, we
      explore this idea by measuring the valence and arousal of the twelve most popular
      emotion keywords expressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter. We do this in
      three geographical regions: Europe, Asia and North America. We demonstrate that
      in our sample, the valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords differ
      significantly with respect to these geographical regions --- Europeans are, or at
      least present themselves as more positive and aroused, North Americans are more
      negative and Asians appear to be more positive but less aroused when compared to
      global valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords. Our work is the
      first in kind to programatically map large text corpora to a dimensional model of
      affect.</p>
