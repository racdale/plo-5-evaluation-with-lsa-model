	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How does a person's personal space change when the person
      approaches or retreats from another person? In this study, we examine the
      anisotropy of personal space in a virtual room constructed by three-dimensional
      computer graphics. In two experiments, a participant took the first-person point
      of view, and an unfamiliar avatar was placed in the virtual room. The
      stop-distance technique was used to measure the personal space between the
      participant and avatar. The participant was required to approach the avatar until
      he or she felt uncomfortable (approaching condition) or to retreat from it until
      he or she felt comfortable (retreating condition). We also controlled the room
      size and the unfamiliar avatar's direction. The results clearly showed that the
      personal space was larger under the approaching condition than under the
      retreating condition. Moreover, we found that  the avatar's direction influenced
      the effect of the room size on personal space.</p>
