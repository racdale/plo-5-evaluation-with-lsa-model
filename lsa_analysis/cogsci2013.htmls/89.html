	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research suggests that people often recall individual
      items when sets are smaller than four and aggregate set features for sets larger
      than four. One intriguing possibility is that the process of aggregating sets
      creates summary representations that maintain the statistical properties of the
      set itself. For sets of numbers, this process might implicitly create approximate
      means. We report the results of two experiments investigating memory for number
      sets and its relation to working memory and metacognitive monitoring. In both
      experiments, participants were shown a series of data sets that varied in size
      (4, 6, or 8 numbers) and variance (10% or 20% of the mean) and were then
      presented with an actual value from the set and the set mean. In Experiment 1,
      participants were asked to select the actual value, and in Experiment 2,
      participants were asked to select the set mean. Results indicated that the
      proportion of correct selections and metacognitive confidence decreased with set
      size. Working memory was related to performance only when the set size was 6. The
      findings suggest that participants often erroneously reported the set mean as
      being a member of the set and that this effect increased for sets larger than
      four. The findings suggest that the process of aggregating number sets results in
      approximate means.</p>
