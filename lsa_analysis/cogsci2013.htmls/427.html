	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We tested the computational feasibility of the proposal that
      open-ended cultural evolution was made possible by two cognitive transitions: (1)
      onset of the capacity to chain thoughts together, followed by (2) onset of
      contextual focus (CF): the capacity to shift between a divergent mode of thought
      conducive to `breaking out of a rut' and a convergent mode of thought conducive
      to minor modifications. These transitions were simulated in EVOC, an agent-based
      model of cultural evolution, in which the fitness of agents' actions increases as
      agents invent ideas for new actions, and imitate the fittest of their neighbors'
      actions. Both mean fitness and diversity of actions across the society increased
      with chaining, and even more so with CF, as hypothesized. CF was only effective
      when the fitness function changed, which supports its hypothesized role in
      generating and refining ideas.</p>
