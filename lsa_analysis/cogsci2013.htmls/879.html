	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Upon reading headlines like &#8220;Traffic Fatalities Fell Last
      Year,&#8221; people often overestimate how well they would have anticipated
      changes. In the present study, participants who estimated fatality statistics and
      listed possible causes before learning true statistics (Foresight) were more
      surprised than those who listed possible causes only after learning true
      statistics (Hindsight). Pezzo (2003) linked hindsight bias to causal explanations
      that minimize initial surprise after an outcome&#8212;but to what extent can
      people build an expectation for alternative causation before learning the true
      outcome? Before seeing true statistics, a subset of our Foresight participants
      listed causes for changes in the opposite of their expected direction. This did
      not reduce surprise for those who learned that statistics had moved in the
      opposite of expected direction, but the number of opposite causes they provided
      reliably predicted their second set of estimates. Moreover, participants
      frequently explained surprising statistics using their earlier alternative
      causes.</p>
