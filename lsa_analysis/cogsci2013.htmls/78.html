	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The process of generating a new hypothesis often begins with the
      recognition that all of the hypotheses currently under consideration are wrong.
      While this sort of falsification is straightforward when the observations are
      incompatible with each of the hypotheses, an interesting situation arises when
      the observations are implausible under the hypotheses but not incompatible with
      them. We propose a formal account, inspired by statistical model checking, as an
      explanation for how people reason about these probabilistic falsifications. We
      contrast this account with approaches such as Bayesian inference that account for
      hypothesis comparison but do not explain how a reasoner might decide that the
      hypothesis space needs to be expanded.</p>
