	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How does social presence influence the perception of a physical
      environment? People think about social relationships in terms of space. For
      instance, when drawing routes on maps they draw paths closer to friends than
      strangers (Matthews & Matlock, 2011). How does the mere presence of a friend
      alter spatial reasoning?

      Here, participants imagined working for an outdoor magazine. They viewed photos
      of bridges one might encounter while hiking. Some participants were told they
      preferred crossing bridges last (in a group), while others were told they
      preferred crossing them first. All participants estimated bridge length. Those
      who crossed last, and imagined their friends on the other side of the bridge,
      provided reliably shorter length estimates than those who crossed first and
      imagined their friends standing immediately behind them.

      These results provide new insights into how social presence can influence our
      perceptions of physical environments. </p>
