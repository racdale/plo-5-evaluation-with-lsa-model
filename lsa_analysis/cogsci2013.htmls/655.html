	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The extent to which people learning categories generalize should
      depend in part on their beliefs about how the instances were sampled. Bayesian
      models of sampling have been successful in predicting that generalization can
      decrease as more instances of a category are encountered. This has only been
      shown in tasks were instances are all from the same category, but contrasts with
      the predictions from most standard models of categorization that predict when
      multiple categories exist, people are more likely to generalize to categories
      that have more instances when distances between categories is controlled. In this
      current work we show that in both one- and two-category scenarios, people adjust
      their generalization behavior based on cover story and number of instances. These
      patterns of generalization at an individual level for both one- and two-category
      scenarios were well accounted for by a Bayesian model that relies on a mixture of
      sampling assumptions.</p>
