	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In current theories of word reading the structure and operations
      of the phonological buffer are quite underspecified. We investigated this issue
      by running a reading aloud experiment in Italian. We adopted a priming paradigm,
      with three-syllabic words as primes and targets and we jointly manipulated two
      effects ascribed to the stage of phonological and phonetic encoding, that is
      stress priming and syllable frequency. Target words varying for the frequency of
      their initial syllable were preceded by words congruent or incongruent for the
      stress pattern.  The results showed an interaction between syllable frequency and
      stress prime, with the stress congruency effect larger for the targets with
      low-frequency first  syllable. This result suggests that, in reading aloud,
      stress assignment and syllable computation have a tight time dynamics in the
      phonological output buffer, and that the process at the level of
      phonology-to-phonetic interface operates interactively.</p>
