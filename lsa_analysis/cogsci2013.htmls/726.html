	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research assumed the eye movement patterns change along
      with the growth of word knowledge while children become skilled readers. In this
      study, the effects of orthographic and configuration information on Chinese
      character recognition were investigated by comparing eye movement patterns from a
      developmental perspective (15 third-grade 27 sixth-grade schoolers, and 41
      undergraduates). Eye movement patterns were recorded in a character decision task
      by varying configuration type (left-right, up-down), radical position-based
      frequencies (HH, HL, LH, LL), and radical position regularities (P, SN, WN). The
      results showed that the two different configurations lead to different eye
      movement patterns: (1) radical position regularity effect was only significant at
      the left-right configuration for all age groups; (2) frequency effect and
      development variation appeared for both two configuration types. These findings
      highlight the importance of configuration knowledge and orthographic awareness
      for learning Chinese characters.</p>
