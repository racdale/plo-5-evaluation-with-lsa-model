	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We studied decision making in situations in which there is a
      monetary incentive to take risk, and in which the risk taking option sometimes
      involves deception. We conducted a within participant experiment in which we
      compared risk taking in deception conditions to pure (non-deceptive) gambles with
      equivalent risks and outcomes. We confirmed the four-fold pattern of risk
      attitudes in both conditions. We found that participants chose fewer risky
      options when the risky
      option was associated with deception, but that those who deceived more in the
      deception condition also took more risks in the gamble condition. We conclude
      that people who tend to take risks in gambles, also take them when it involves
      deception, although to a lesser extent.
