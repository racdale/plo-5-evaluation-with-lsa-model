	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent evidence has suggested that the relationship between a 
      test of fluid intelligence, Raven's Progressive Matrices, and working memory
      capacity (WMC) may be invariant across difficulty levels of the Raven's items. We
      show that this invariance can only be observed if the overall correlation between
      Raven's and WMC is low. We demonstrate that by using a composite measure of WMC,
      which yields a higher correlation between WMC and Raven's than reported in
      previous studies, that there was a significant positive relationship between
      Raven's item difficulty and the extent of the itemwise correlation with WMC. This
      result puts strong constraints on theories of reasoning and challenges some
      existing views.</p>
