	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Building on dual-space theories, the three-space theory of problem
      solving suggests to add search of a model space in addition to search of
      experiment and hypothesis space. This study aimed at exploring the three
      postulated spaces, especially model space, by means of verbal protocols.

      Participants (n=32) were asked to think aloud while working with a computer based
      learning program. With this program they could learn about torques in physics
      using interactive graphics in which experiments could be conducted. Their
      knowledge about torques was tested before and after working with the program.
      Verbal protocols were analyzed with regard to the amount of search of the three
      spaces and regarding the quality of the participants&#8217; models for torques.

      Our results add to the validity of model space, showing that the three postulated
      spaces could be reliably identified in the protocols and that the model quality
      score predicted final knowledge beyond prior knowledge. </p>
