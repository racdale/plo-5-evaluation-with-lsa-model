	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In two experiments we provided evidence for a joint interference
      effect in picture naming. Participants took longer to name pictures when they
      believed that their partner concurrently named pictures than when they believed
      their partner was silent (Experiment 1) or concurrently categorized the pictures
      as being from the same or from different semantic categories (Experiment 2).
      However, picture naming latencies were not affected by beliefs about what
      one&#8217;s partner said. These findings are consistent with the idea that
      speakers represent whether another speaker is preparing to speak, but not what
      they are preparing to say.</p>
