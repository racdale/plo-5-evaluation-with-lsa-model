	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Deception can be advantageous to a deceiver when the truth
      conflicts with his or her goals - be they personal or social, selfless or
      selfish. Thus it is that people regularly use deception to avoid conflict with
      others, to avoid punishment or embarrassment, to fit into a group, to harm,
      protect or help others, and for material or non-material benefit to themselves.
      While there are many ways in which people can deceive, for example, by choosing
      to fabricate rather than to tell a half-truth, there are always cost-benefit
      trade-offs,
      regardless of the strategy a person chooses. Understanding why people deceive in
      everyday life situations, how they do it, why they choose one strategy over
      another, and why sometimes they might choose not to deceive at all, even in
      the absence of any serious anticipated cost, will enable us to build richer
      models of socially intelligent behavior--models that could be employed in
      computational systems designed to facilitate enterprises such as elder care,
      tutoring, and professional training. In this workshop, we aim to address
      three basic questions: (1) what factors lead people to deceive? (2) what makes
      them decide to deceive one way rather than another? and (3) how can we model
      these factors computationally?</p>
