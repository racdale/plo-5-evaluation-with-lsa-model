	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper introduces a cognitive tutor designed for second
      language grammar instruction. The tutor adopted Corbett and Anderson&#8217;s
      (1995) Bayesian knowledge tracing model and provided adaptive training on the
      English article system. We followed the Competition Model (MacWhinney, 1997) and
      understood the article system as a galaxy of cues determining article usage on
      the basis of form-function mapping. Cues are in competition during language
      acquisition; hence cue contrast is predicted to be an effective instructional
      method. Seventy-eight students were randomly assigned to four article training
      conditions (to learn 33 cues) and a control condition (to write essays). We found
      that article-training groups significantly outperformed the control group in an
      immediate posttest and a delayed posttest. Specifically, our result also
      suggested that there was a significant interaction between cue contrast and cue
      type (definite vs. indefinite). Cue contrast promoted more learning on the
      indefinite cues (more difficult for learners). Knowledge tracing did not
      demonstrate such an interactional effect with cue types. Instead, it boosted the
      instructional effect promoted by cue contrast.</p>
