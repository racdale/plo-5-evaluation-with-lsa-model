	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Bilingual speakers are confronted with a unique challenge when
      learning language as they must learn to express the same concept in two separate
      languages. Here, we examine whether learning number words in one language (i.e.,
      L1) facilitates the acquisition of analogous number words in a second language
      (i.e., L2) or whether extensive experience and familiarity with numbers within
      the second language is required to learn words in L2. To do so, we tested 68
      bilinguals speakers between the ages of 2 and 4 years and show that conceptual
      knowledge of numbers in L1 reliably predicted children&#8217;s conceptual
      knowledge of numbers in L2, suggesting that knowledge transferred from one
      language to the other. The effect, however, was limited to two developmental
      transitions: one-knower to two-knower and subset knower to CP-knower. Familiarity
      with L2 numbers as well as age were also significant predictors of
      children&#8217;s conceptual understanding of numbers. </p>
