	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This experiment sought to explore the theory that familiar English
      words are processed similarly to objects. To do this, we looked for object-based
      attentional facilitation where cues in a different location to the target still
      facilitate target detection as long as they are inside the same object.
      Participants were shown two English words in an array, and cues and targets were
      embedded inside them. Reaction times for target detection were measured. It was
      found that in horizontally presented English words, cues presented in a different
      location to the target still facilitated target detection if they occurred inside
      the same word. This was not the case for vertically oriented words. It was
      concluded that familiar words in a familiar orientation are indeed processed in a
      similar way to objects. These findings may be indicative that the cortical
      networks that evolved for object processing are also involved in the processing
      of words.</p>
