	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper, we test between suppression and activation accounts
      of metaphor processing by means of a novel metaphor interference paradigm using
      mouse-tracking. The goal is to understand how context influences the activation
      of salient and non-salient features of a concept during the on-line processing of
      a metaphor. In two mouse-tracking experiments, we examine the activation and
      availability of conceptual features that were either irrelevant or relevant for
      understanding a metaphor across various contexts. Our findings support the
      conclusion that context works primarily by rapidly suppressing salient features
      of a concept that are not relevant for the particular metaphorical
      interpretation. What is more, it seems that even further contextual manipulation
      does not facilitate the activation of non-salient metaphor relevant features.
