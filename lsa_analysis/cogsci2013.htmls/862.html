	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent evidence suggests that fractions are represented as
      visuo-spatial analog magnitudes on a &#8220;mental number line&#8221; (Schneider
      and Siegler, 2010). In order to test this theory, we evaluated subjects in two
      tasks: fraction comparison and number-line marking. Both magnitude difference and
      response time to mark a fraction on the number line predicted response time to
      compare the fraction&#8217;s magnitude to a standard held in memory. This
      supports the notion that even symbolic numerical cognition is grounded in
      visuo-spatial processing. We also found a symbolic cost to processing: fractions
      with more digits were processed more slowly. We propose a model of fraction
      comparison wherein fractions are processed from symbols into analog magnitudes,
      then compared to a standard by sequential sampling decision-making. This model
      provides a superior fit when compared to the log distance model, despite having
      fewer parameters. Furthermore, it has a direct interpretation in terms of
      psychological processes.</p>
