	<h1>Semantics: Intuition, Experiment or Illusion?</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Externalist theories in natural language semantics have become the
      orthodoxy since Kripke is widely thought to have refuted descriptive theories
      involving internal cognitive representation of meaning. This shift may be seen in
      developments in philosophy of language of the 1970s &#8211; the direct reference
      &#8220;revolution against Frege&#8221; (Wettstein 2004). Almog (2005) writes of
      the &#8220;uprising against Frege&#8217;s doctrines&#8221; that &#8220;spread
      like fire&#8221; based on the work of Kripke, Donnellan, Putnam and Kaplan.
      However, I consider Fodor&#8217;s (2004) heretical thought that something has
      gone &#8220;awfully wrong&#8221; in this philosophical consensus, perhaps
      confirming Chomsky&#8217;s (1992) view that the whole field of philosophical
      semantics is &#8220;utterly wrongheaded&#8221; and &#8220;crazy&#8221; by virtue
      of its non-naturalist assumptions and &#8220;methodological dualism.&#8221; I
      suggest that the externalist orthodoxy is a kind of cognitive illusion seen
      elsewhere in philosophy and cognitive science.</p>
