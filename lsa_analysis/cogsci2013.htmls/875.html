	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Worry consists of intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts, usually
      in verbal form, about a future event of uncertain outcome. Excessive occupation
      of working memory (WM) subsystems by worry-related representations might cause
      deficits in WM performance and efficiency. Attentional Control Theory (ACT)
      predicts that worry occupies the central executive, but not the storage
      components of WM (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad). We tested worry
      effects on visuospatial and verbal WM memory tasks, with and without binding, in
      46 Brazilian undergradutes divided into a low-worry (LW, n=21, 11 female) and a
      high-worry (HW, n=25, 23 female) group. The HW group showed significantly lower
      accuracy in the verbal tasks and higher reaction times in the visuospatial tasks.
      Within the HW group, binding caused lower accuracy in the visual task and lower
      RTs in the verbal task. Results are discussed according to ACT, which predicts
      differential effects of worry on performance and efficiency accross WM
      modalities.</p>
