	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present an approach to health interventions based on the
      insight that throughout life, individuals construct intuitive theories to
      predict, explain, and determine how to act on the world. We propose that	 an
      intuitive theory-based approach may be useful for teaching adults about the
      body's biochemical response to exercise. The first step in using this approach is
      to document the theories that a target population brings to bear on a health
      domain. We therefore present what is to our knowledge the first investigation of
      adults' reasoning about exercise. Specifically, we explore how adults explain why
      exercise confers various benefits, how plausible adults find the physical,
      emotional, and cognitive benefits of exercise, and how contingent on weight loss
      adults believe such benefits to be. These findings lay the groundwork for
      constructing an intervention to motivate adults to exercise more.</p>
