	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research investigating top-down attentional capture has
      demonstrated a tight coupling of working memory content with attention and eye
      movements. By capitalizing on this relationship, we have developed a novel
      methodology called the Memory Activation Capture (MAC) procedure for measuring
      the dynamics of working memory content supporting complex cognitive tasks (e.g.,
      decision making, problem solving). By observing which items are preferentially
      fixated in task irrelevant arrays containing task relevant information, we gain a
      measure of working memory content as the task evolves through time. The efficacy
      of the MAC procedure is demonstrated in a hypothesis generation task. Results
      suggest a two-stage process following hypothesis retrieval whereby it undergoes a
      brief period of heightened activation before entering a lower activation state
      while being maintained for output. The present effects are of additional general
      interest as they represent the first demonstrations of top-down attentional
      capture driven by participant-established WM content retrieved from long-term
      memory.</p>
