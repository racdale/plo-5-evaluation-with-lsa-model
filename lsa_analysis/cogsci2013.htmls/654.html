	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Probability judgments about logical propositions have raised
      substantial doubts about human rationality. Here we explore the idea that
      people&#8217;s probability judgments often may not refer to the relative
      frequency of a set, but instead to the probability of an explanatory logical
      pattern given the data. This idea has been formalized by Bayesian logic (BL),
      predicting a system of frequency-based logical inclusion fallacies. The studies
      presented concentrate on comparing probability judgments about sentences
      logically relating two attributes of a class or an individual (humans, animals,
      artifacts). Although BL cannot model probabilities of individual predications
      directly, it can do so if one assumes that inferences are made about unknown
      individuals based on imagined samples. The results for general as well as
      individual predication show a high number of systematic inclusion fallacies in
      line with BL. Nevertheless, some deviations were found. In the General
      Discussion, a polycausal approach to inclusion fallacies is advocated.</p>
