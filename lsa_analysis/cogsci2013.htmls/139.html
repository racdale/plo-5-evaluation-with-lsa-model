	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Retrieval that is based on common relational structure, such as an
      underlying principle or pattern, is useful but typically rare. Based on evidence
      that comparison-derived schema abstraction can improve relational retrieval, we
      asked whether the use of relational labels can also promote abstraction and
      improve relational retrieval. Using a cued-recall paradigm, we varied the
      presence of relational labels at encoding and test. As compared to a no-label
      baseline condition, relational retrieval improved when relational labels were
      given at encoding and at test and also when relational labels were given only at
      encoding. The findings demonstrate that one way to improve relational retrieval
      is through the use of labels that name relational structure.</p>
