	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A widespread and powerful model of socially interactive behavior
      is &#8216;synchrony&#8217; (Jirsa & Kelso, 2004): Numerous studies have thus
      recently indicated how individuals through social interaction become increasingly
      entrained on multiple levels from physiology to syntax: through interaction
      people synchronize their heart rates, their subtle postural sways, their gestures
      and gaze behaviors, align their lexicon and their syntax. However, emerging
      scholarship is increasingly attending to many instances in which patterns of
      complementary and asynchronous actions rather than synchronous ones seem to
      predict high levels of interpersonal coordination and joint performance. While
      some activities such as expertly timed rowing may afford interacting agents to
      synchronize their individual behaviours to reach high levels of joint
      performance, other types of joint activity &#8211; like playing a game of
      baseball &#8211; rather afford complementary actions: i.e. tightly coupled,
      reciprocal activity derived from different behaviours performed across an
      extended temporal sequence.</p>
