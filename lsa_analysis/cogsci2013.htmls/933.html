	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aims of the current study are to analyze research evidence of
      the ways in which collective recall exhibits extended social identity effects .
      Our core hypothesis was that the use of Twitter as a recall tool significantly
      contributes to social identity generation in general and self-categorization in
      particular. Based on a study of a representative sample of Latvian-language
      Twittersphere, we argue that a social network serves a two-fold role: (a) it
      extends the individual self as part of a distributed social reality and as part
      of a distributed on-line social network. 
      The core results of our study show that Twitter functions as an extended
      distributive linguistic cognitive system supporting different kinds of recall
      tasks while at the same time exhibiting strong categorization effects through
      eliminating redundant information and reducing the descriptive complexity of the
      environment in recall.
