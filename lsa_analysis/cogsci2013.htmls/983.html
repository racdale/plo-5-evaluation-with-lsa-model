	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Languages exhibit statistical regularities concerning the
      frequencies and co-occurrences of words. Language users learn from such patterns
      without being consciously aware of them. We investigated statistical properties
      of the language used on television news in discussing politicians. We compiled
      corpora consisting of language used on four networks (MSNBC, ABCNews, CNN,
      FOXNews) from 2007-2012. We analyzed the frequencies with which 500
      affectively-valenced words co-occurred with politicians' names (Obama, McCain,
      Romney) during the run-ups to the 2008 and 2012 elections. We used these
      co-occurrences to derive a summary measure, their net positivity score.
      Positivity scores for candidates changed over time in ways that reflect
      real-world events. Positivity towards candidates differed across networks. Net
      positivity toward President Obama during his first term was strongly correlated
      with approval ratings. The results show that statistical aspects of language, of
      which people are not consciously aware, convey varying attitudes on network
      news.</p>
