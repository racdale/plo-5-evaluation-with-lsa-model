	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>During collaboration, people communicate using verbal and
      non-verbal cues, including gaze cues. Social factors can affect gaze allocation,
      however most research on gaze cueing has not considered these factors. The
      presence of social roles was manipulated in a collaborative task whilst eye
      movements were measured. In pairs, participants worked together to make a cake.
      Half of the pairs were given roles (&#8220;Chef&#8221; or &#8220;Gatherer&#8221;)
      and the other half were not. Across all participants we found, contrary to the
      results of static image experiments, that participants spent very little time
      looking at each other, challenging the generalisability of the conclusions from
      lab-based paradigms. When given spoken instructions, listeners in the roles
      condition looked at the speaker significantly more than listeners in the no roles
      condition. We conclude that our tendency to seek the gaze cues of collaborators
      is affected either by our social perceptions of the collaborator or their
      perceived reliability.</p>
