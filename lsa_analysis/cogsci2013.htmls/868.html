	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The Glamorgan Problem Solver (GLAM-PS), an example of a
      computationally implemented theory of embodied cognition, is a novel cognitive
      architecture that has been applied to algebra problem solving, Tower of London
      problem solving and Stroop Tasks. GLAM-PS is a distributed production system
      architecture, with all modules playing a role either in perception or action. 
      Each module has its own working memory, production memory and production matching
      bottleneck.  Inter-module communication allows each module to see the working
      memory of other modules and to coordinate action with activity in other modules. 
      Despite the lack of explicit goal representation the architecture is able to
      model offline multi-step problem solving in algebra.  Action representations are
      used to hierarchically structure action in Tower of London problem solving,
      allowing &#8216;subgoaling&#8217; of particular disks.  Performance on Stroop
      Tasks highlights the architecture&#8217;s ability to model controlled behaviour. 
      These domains demonstrate GLAM-PS potential for providing insights into human
      behaviour.</p>
