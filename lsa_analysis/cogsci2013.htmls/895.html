	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Human communication compresses a massive amount of conceptual
      structure into conventionalized speech patterns. How do these patterns emerge?
      Experimental semiotics offers new empirical techniques to address such questions
      (Fay et al., 2008; Galantucci, 2005; Garrod et al., 2007; Kirby et al., 2008). We
      devised an experiment to observe the emergence of communicative conventions. The
      study explores the development of vocal communication systems through an
      iterative Vocal Charades game. The game is played by two players each given a
      stack of 12 cards. Written on each card is a word from six antonymic pairs
      (rough/smooth, bad/good, etc.). Over ten rounds, players took turns
      &#8220;vocalizing&#8221; the meaning of their words without using language or
      gestures. Analyses reveal how sounds conventionalize, leading to stereotyped
      forms and improved guessing. The conventional forms that develop are predicted by
      iconic correspondences with meaning, but also exhibit more arbitrary features
      that distinguish semantically similar words.</p>
