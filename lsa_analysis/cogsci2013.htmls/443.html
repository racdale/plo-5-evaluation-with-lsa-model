	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Two experiments investigated the production and comprehension of
      referring expressions that contain a negative property ("the marker without a
      cap"). Experiment 1 showed that participants do use negative properties in their
      object descriptions, but that they were almost always accompanied by other
      properties, leading to referential overspecification. In experiment 2,
      participants identified objects based on descriptions that contained negative
      properties. While participants were faster in identifying objects that were
      described with preferred properties such as color, response times for objects
      described with a negative property ("the marker without a cap") and a positive
      property ("the marker with a cap") did not differ. The results provide behavioral
      grounds for extending referring expression generation algorithms to include
      negative properties.</p>
