	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A number of popular philosophical and psychological theories that
      model causality in terms of causal dependency assume that causal relations in
      chains are transitive. When A causes B, and B causes C it typically follows that
      A also causes C. In contrast, dispositional theories focus on intrinsic causal
      properties (i.e., causal dispositions) of the involved participants of causal
      relations. According to this account, a causal chain is transitive only when A
      originally has a disposition towards C. We present an experiment that contrasts
      scenarios with transitive chains (A disposes towards C) and scenarios with
      intransitive chains (A does not dispose towards C), according to the
      dispositional account. In line with dispositional theories of causation, we found
      a strong dissociation between cause-effect judgments (A causes C) and probability
      judgments, P(C|A), in intransitive scenarios but not in transitive scenarios.
      Across both types of scenarios judgments for single relations did not differ.
