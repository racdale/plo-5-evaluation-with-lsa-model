	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It is sometimes argued that implementation of an overall
      similarity classification is less effortful than implemen- tation of a
      single-dimension classification. One piece of evidence taken to be in support of
      this argument is that highly impulsive individuals appear to be more likely to
      sort on the basis of overall similarity than individuals with low impulsivity
      (Ward, 1983); presumably, higher impulsivity results in lower effort. In the
      current arti- cle, we identify some limitations in Ward&#8217;s procedure and,
      using a more standard measure of impulsivity and a less ambiguous measure of
      overall similarity classifica- tion, re-investigate the relationship between
      impulsivity and overall similarity classification. Using a match-to- standard
      procedure, the current experiment finds that overall similarity classification is
      less prevalent in highly impulsive individuals. The implications of this result,
      which is opposite to that reported by Ward (1983), are discussed.</p>
