	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present a neural network model of the storage of episode
      representations in working memory (WM). Our key idea is that episodes are encoded
      in WM as prepared sensorimotor routines: i.e. as prepared sequences of
      attentional and motor operations. Our network reproduces several experimental
      findings about the representation of prepared sequences in prefrontal cortex.
      Interpreted as a model of WM episode representations, it has useful applications
      in an account of long-term memory for episodes and in accounts of sentence
      processing.</p>
