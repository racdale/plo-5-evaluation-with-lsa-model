	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The current study examined reactions to the precision of
      earnings&#8217; forecasts in hypothetical investment decisions. In a forced
      choice task, participants were found to be indifferent between point (e.g., $2)
      or range (e.g., $1.70-$2.30) forecast formats when both outcomes were favorable
      (i.e., above market expectation). When the outcomes were unfavorable (below
      expectation), participants&#8217; preferences were significantly biased towards
      range estimates. When faced with options which mixed forecast formats and
      favorability, participants almost always opted for forecasts with a favorable
      outlook regardless of format. These results are inconsistent with domain specific
      ambiguity reactions found previously (Du, 2009) and also offer no support for the
      domain specific anchoring hypothesis (e.g. Du, 2009; Du & Budescu, 2005). These
      findings raise some doubts about the generality of domain specific reactions to
      uncertainty and suggest that such effects might be dependent, in part, on the
      (financial) sophistication of participants. </p>
