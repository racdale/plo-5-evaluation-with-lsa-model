	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Binocular rivalry displays and ambiguous figures such as the
      Necker cube elicit a perceptual reversal effect mediated by attentional and
      perceptual processes. Perceptual dominance times are highly variable between
      individuals and may be partially influenced by genetic factors. This study
      examined the role of putative genetic effects associated with familial
      sinistrality, derived from a novel pedigree-based genetic model. In a continuous
      Necker viewing task, dominance times were significantly correlated (R-square =
      .36) with a multifactorial estimate of genetic effects associated with non
      right-handedness. No association with genetic estimates was found in an
      intermittent viewing condition. These results suggest that genetic factors
      associated with functional asymmetries may also affect noise-based perceptual
      alternation, but not short term visual memory.</p>
