	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Reference is a key mechanism in human communication which has long
      been studied in different areas of Cognitive Science. The PRE-CogSci 2013
      workshop, which focusses on the production/generation of referring expressions,
      follows in the footsteps of two earlier CogSci workshops in seeking to forge
      closer links between the approaches that are associated with the different
      disciplines, with special attention to psycholinguistics and computational
      linguistics.  Peer-reviewed contributions on all aspects of the
      production/generation of referring expressions are solicited. Special themes of
      the workshop will include: (1) Collaborative reference, (2) Nondeterminism in
      production, (3) Interaction between comprehension and production, and (4)
      Combinations with research in vision. There will be invited presentations by Herb
      Clark and by Noah Goodman.</p>
