	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research into human models of intuitive physics typically falls
      into one of two camps, either claiming that intuitive physics is biased and not
      representative of real physics, or claiming that it consists of a collection of
      veridical physical laws. Here we investigate the causes of this tension,
      suggesting that prediction is based on real physics, but explanation is
      susceptible to biases. We gave participants three tasks based on the same
      physical principles: two prediction tasks and one task that required drawing the
      future path of motion. We found distinct biases in all three tasks; however, the
      two prediction tasks could be explained by consistent application of real
      physical principles under uncertainty, while the drawing task produced many more
      idiosyncratic biases. This suggests that different tests of intuitive physics are
      capturing different types of knowledge about the world.</p>
