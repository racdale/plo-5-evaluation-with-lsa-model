	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous studies of semantic implicit learning in language have
      only examined learning grammatical form-meaning connections where learning could
      have been supported by prior linguistic knowledge. Also, these studies assessed
      awareness by verbal report, which is arguably not the most reliable measure. Here
      we target the domain of verb meaning, specifically semantic preferences of novel
      verbs (e.g. a novel verb takes abstract objects). Using a reaction time
      methodology we show that after exposure to correct verb-noun combinations,
      reaction times to incorrect combinations are slowed down even for participants
      who are unaware of the semantic regularity. This effect was also obtained even
      when the semantic regularity was irrelevant to the tasks being performed,
      suggesting that the semantic generalisation is learned and exerts its influence
      automatically, hence satisfying one criterion for implicitness. Combined with a
      lack of verbalisable knowledge in any participant these experiments provide
      strong evidence for semantic implicit learning in language. </p>
