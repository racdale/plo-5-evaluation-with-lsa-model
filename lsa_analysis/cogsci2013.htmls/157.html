	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>During the school semester, students face an onslaught of new
      material. Students work hard to achieve initial mastery of the material, but soon
      their skill degrades or they forget. Although students and educators both
      appreciate that review can help stabilize learning, time constraints result in a
      trade off between acquiring new knowledge and preserving old knowledge. To use
      time efficiently, when should review take place? Experimental studies have shown
      benefits to long-term retention with spaced study, but little practical advice is
      available to students and educators about the optimal spacing of study. The
      dearth of advice is due to the challenge of conducting experimental studies of
      learning in educational settings where material is introduced in blocks over the
      time frame of a semester. In this paper, we turn to two established models of
      memory---ACT-R and MCM---to conduct simulation studies exploring the impact of
      study schedule on long-term retention. Based on the premise of fixed time each
      week to review, converging evidence from the two models suggests that an optimal
      review schedule obtains significant benefits over haphazard (suboptimal) review
      schedules. Further, we identify two scheduling heuristics that obtain near
      optimal review performance: (1) review the material from u-weeks back, and (2)
      review material whose predicted memory strength is closest to theta. The former
      has implications for classroom instruction and the latter for the design of
      electronic tutors.</p>
