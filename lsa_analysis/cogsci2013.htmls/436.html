	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Development of analogical reasoning is often explained by general
      maturation of executive functions. A consequence of the involvement of executive
      functions would be that children and adults differ in the visual strategies they
      apply when solving analogical problems. Since visual strategies can be studied by
      means of eye-tracking, we compared the visual scanpaths of children and adults in
      three different analogical reasoning tasks. This comparison was done by means of
      a novel technique that combined a recently developed algorithm for computing  a
      &#8220;distance&#8221; between any pair of scanpaths (Jarodzka, Holmqvist, &
      Nystr&#246;m, 2010), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and a neural network
      classifier. This analysis clearly showed a difference between adults' and
      children's visual strategies in solving analogy problems. We focus both on the
      demonstration that adults and children employ different visual search strategies
      to solve analogy problems and on the novel technique used to do this. This
      general technique complements other approaches to eye-movement analysis that rely
      on local properties of scanpaths, in particular, item-fixation times.</p>
