	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Existing studies on causal structure learning are largely
      restricted to single-shot interventions, usually in constrained or deterministic
      scenarios. However, real world causal learning is generally noisy, incremental
      and constrained only by prior beliefs. Here we describe experiments where
      participants were incentivised to infer the causal structure of probabilistic
      models through the free selection of multiple interventions. Participants&#8217;
      sequences of intervention choices and on-line structure judgements were measured
      against those of an efficient Bayesian learner, which integrates information
      perfectly and intervenes to maximise expected utility. Successful participants
      were systematic and learned effectively, but chose markedly different
      intervention sequences to those of a Bayesian learner. Overall, we find evidence
      suggesting that causal structure learning is achieved by iteration of simple
      action-selection and causal-attribution mechanisms.</p>
