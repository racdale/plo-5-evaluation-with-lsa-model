	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the behavior of participants tasked with com-
      municating in a novel environment. Participants had to use their mouse to draw
      graphical representations (termed squig- gles in the game) of human faces in
      order to communicate with fellow players. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of
      varying features of the input images on the resulting drawings. Ex- periment 2
      introduced varying comprehension conditions that were predicted to produce
      differences in how features of faces would be graphically represented. In
      experiment 1, the fea- tures of the different faces significantly shaped the
      structure of the resulting squiggles. In experiment 2, the structure of the
      squiggles was influenced by the environment in which they were interpreted.</p>
