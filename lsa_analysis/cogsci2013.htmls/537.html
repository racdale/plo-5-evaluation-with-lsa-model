	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Few studies have investigated multitasking in joint actions,
      especially two joint actions performed by two people together and coordinated via
      multimodal communication. We investigate the case of two people walking and
      talking together, a common combination of joint actions. In an experiment, pairs
      talked together in four varying conditions of mobility. A narrator told a story
      to a partner. They did this while either standing immobile, walking along a
      straight-line itinerary, or walking along a complex itinerary featuring several
      turns. They also completed a walking task along a complex itinerary without
      having to tell a story. One person (the navigator) was also entrusted with a map
      of the itinerary. We analyzed how participants coordinated turning while telling
      a story. Narrators relied more on verbal means to signal turning, and were more
      distracted during the turn, leading to more repetition of story-related content.
