	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There have been two distinct notions of heuristics, i.e., Kahneman
      and Tversky&#8217;s (1974) heuristics as biased approximations to rational
      inference, and Gigerenzer et al.&#8217;s (1999) idea of smart and adaptive
      heuristics. Despite the conceptual differences, we provide evidence that
      heuristics can be seen as approximations to a rational account which is at its
      core adaptive. In a large cross-validation, we demonstrate that a regularized
      regression model (from machine learning) with a penalty noise parameter could
      outperform both heuristics and simple linear regression. Importantly, the
      penalized regression with an L2-norm could be approximated by tallying, whereas
      the L1-norm was approximated by take-the-best. Results indicate that the
      penalized regression treats both heuristics and linear regression as extreme
      cases of the model. The research implies a common rational basis for heuristics
      and integrative strategies, suggesting that the relation need not be adversarial.
      Implications for reconciling adaptive and irrational views of heuristics are
      discussed.</p>
