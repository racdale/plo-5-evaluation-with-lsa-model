	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Social-interactive cognition in Russia builds on the ideas of
      cultural-historical psychology by L. Vygotsky, A. Leontyev, A. Luria, as well as
      communicative aspect of cognition introduced by M. Bakhtin in his theory of
      dialogism which, in its turn, laid the ground for the studies of social and
      situated cognition. Since 1980-s cognitive-discursive paradigm in Russia,
      introduced by E. Kubryakova, has attracted attention of cognitive science
      scholars. Within this paradigm cognitive approaches to pragmatics of
      communication and agentivity have been developed (V.Zabotkina, E. Pozdnyakova).

      The given study introduces further development of the field, based on a
      multi-modal corpus built with recorded live communication data. Presently
      it&#8217;s the biggest multi-modal corpus of emotional communication, so it
      ensures completeness and accuracy of research, conducted on its basis. Two- and
      three-dimensional computer agents (A. Kotov) operate a set of speech patterns in
      a complex of restricted communication situations, simulating real-life emotional
      social interaction.</p>
