	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Miscommunication is often regarded as noise or uninformative in
      psycholinguistic research. However, Coupland et al. (1991) suggest that
      miscommunication can provide rich information about how interlocutors come to
      communicate successfully. Successful communication necessarily needs the
      individuals involved to coordinate and update their mutual knowledge,
      experiences, beliefs, and assumptions. However, the process of updating this
      information may be ridden with unsuccessful attempts that eventually help
      interlocutors reach a common goal. This study evaluates the relative contribution
      of linguistic factors to communicative success, based on verbal grounding (e.g.,
      mutual agreement on a referent) and visual congruency (e.g., interlocutor&#8217;s
      visual environments match or mismatch) during a collaborative task. We show that
      varying levels of communicative success are laden with rich linguistic
      information that may uncover interesting aspects of successful and less
      successful communication. </p>
