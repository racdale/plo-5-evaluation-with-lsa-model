	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research on causal-based categorization focuses on how people
      categorize exemplars that have causally linked features. One prominent account,
      the generative model (Rehder, 2003) models membership judgments as a function of
      an exemplar's likelihood being generated by the category's causal model. In
      contrast, Mayrhofer and Rothe (2012) found that the explanatory role of the
      causal model strongly influences membership judgments - indicating the importance
      of explanatory reasoning processes and that in such tasks people might be guided
      by explanatory goodness (i.e., how well an exemplar's membership can be explained
      in the light of the category's causal relations). However, the evidence for this
      claim was quite indirect so far. In the present categorization study, we
      collected judgments about category membership, frequency, and explanatory
      goodness. In contrast to the predictions of the generative model, membership
      ratings are far better resembled by ratings of explanatory goodness than by
      subjects' estimations of exemplar likelihood. </p>
