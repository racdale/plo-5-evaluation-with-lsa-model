	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent studies hypothesize that language production is governed by
      the principle of efficient information transmission: speakers tend to omit
      elements whose information content is contextually predictable while providing
      more linguistic signal to convey otherwise less predictable information. However,
      previous findings in support of this hypothesis are also compatible with
      alternative accounts based on production difficulty. To distinguish between these
      competing accounts, we conducted
      experiments on speaker&#8217;s preference in optional casemarking in Japanese.
      The results suggest that Japanese speakers are more likely to omit the object
      case-marker when an associated noun has semantic properties that are prototypical
      to a grammatical object. Moreover, case-marker omission was
      facilitated when other elements in a sentence made the grammatical function
      assignment more predictable. The results were obtained with all the factors
      related to production difficulty held constant, and thus support the models of
      communicatively efficient language production.</p>
