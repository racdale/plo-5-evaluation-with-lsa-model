	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Taking another person&#8217;s perspective when describing spatial
      scenes is more common when a person is present in the scene. (Tversky & Hard,
      2009). What about seeing another person elicits an allocentric perspective?

      Participants were shown one of a variety of pictures displaying a book and cup
      placed, side-by-side, on a table. Some photos also pictured a man sitting behind
      the table, either facing the camera or facing to the left or right. Viewers were
      more likely to take the man&#8217;s perspective while describing object locations
      when the man was facing the camera than when the man was facing to either side.

      Many factors influence which perspective people take. These results suggest that
      the mere presence of a person in a scene does not guarantee a viewer will take
      someone else&#8217;s perspective, but rather the way a person is positioned in a
      scene might also be of critical importance.
