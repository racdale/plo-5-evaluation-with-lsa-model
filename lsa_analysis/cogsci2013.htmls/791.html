	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research on two classic moral dilemmas, Trolley and Footbridge,
      suggests that one&#8217;s past moral experiences can affect one&#8217;s
      subsequent moral decisions. These dilemmas have interested moral psychologists,
      in part, because they have found that people&#8217;s judgments about the dilemmas
      are affected by the order in which the dilemmas are considered. Furthermore, this
      effect is asymmetrical: people that consider Trolley after Footbridge have
      significantly different judgments than people in control conditions, but the
      converse is not true. We argue that this asymmetry is the result of a difference
      in how the each dilemma affects pre-existing beliefs regarding the importance of
      saving lives. In two experiments, we show that Footbridge disconfirms these
      beliefs, while Trolley does not significantly affect them. Consistent with
      predictions of a belief adjustment model of ordering effects, these findings
      offer a clear and parsimonious account of the asymmetry. </p>
