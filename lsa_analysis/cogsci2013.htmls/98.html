	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Generating explanations and making comparisons have both been
      shown to improve learning. While each process has been studied individually, the
      relationship between explanation and comparison is not well understood. Three
      experiments evaluated the effectiveness of explanation and comparison prompts in
      learning novel categories. In Experiment 1, participants explained items&#8217;
      category membership, performed pairwise comparisons between items (listed
      similarities and differences), did both, or did a control task. The explanation
      task increased the discovery of rules underlying category membership; however,
      the comparison task decreased rule discovery. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that (1)
      comparing all four category exemplars was more effective than either
      within-category or between-category pairwise comparisons, and that (2)
      &#8220;explain&#8221; participants reported higher levels of both spontaneous
      explanation and comparison than &#8220;compare&#8221; participants. This work
      provides insights into when explanation and comparison are most effective, and
      how these processes can work together to maximize learning.</p>
