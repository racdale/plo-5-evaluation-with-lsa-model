	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A Chinese sentence contains no extra spaces between words. We
      hypothesize that implicit word segmentation by Chinese readers is developed via
      the statistical learning mechanism that is universal. Twenty non-Chinese speakers
      were exposed to a sequence of 3600 characters constructed from six disyllabic
      words with 6 different characters. The transitional probabilities between any two
      characters were .46 to 1 within words, and 0 to .29 between words. The sequence
      was presented one character every half a second. Occasionally, the presentation
      rate doubled. The participants&#8217; task was to detect the instances of double
      presentation. Upon completing the task, a surprise test followed that consisted
      of a word and a nonword (reversals of the characters in a word) from the
      sequence. The participants had to decide which one had appeared before. The
      averaged accuracy rate was greater than chance (.53). This suggests the
      statistical learning mechanism is available to all language learners.</p>
