	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Interpretation of a pronoun is driven by properties of syntactic
      distribution. Consequently, acquiring the meaning and the distribution are
      intertwined. In order to learn that a pronoun is reflexive, learners need to know
      which entity the pronoun refers to in a sentence, but in order to infer its
      referent they need to know that the pronoun is reflexive. This study examines
      whether discourse information is the information source that the learner might
      use to acquire grammatical categories of pronouns. Experimental results
      demonstrate that adults can use discourse information to accurately guess the
      referents of pronouns. Simulations show that a Bayesian model using guesses from
      the experiment as an estimate of the discourse information successfully
      categorizes English pronouns into categories corresponding to reflexives and
      non-reflexives. Together, these results suggest that knowing which entities are
      likely to be referred to in the discourse can help learners acquire grammatical
      categories of pronouns.</p>
