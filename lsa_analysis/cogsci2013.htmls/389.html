	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Systems of noun classification serve to categorize entities based
      on a set of semantic and/or phonological features. Previous work, for the most
      part focused on gender-based classes, has suggested that learners acquiring such
      systems rely primarily on phonological cues, while semantic cues are used only
      weakly. We show, using an artificial language learning task with adults, that
      semantic information alone is sufficient to learn a realistic shape-based
      classification system, challenging the view of phonology bias. Further, our
      results show that compared to learners exposed to semantically cohesive
      categories, learners trained on randomly assigned classes are less successful at
      recalling the category of exposure items. This finding suggests that, contrary to
      memory-based theories of learning, categories are not necessarily formed by
      abstraction from memorized exemplars, but can instead be constructed from
      lower-level properties that category members share.
