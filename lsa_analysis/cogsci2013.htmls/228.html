	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Although reasoning skills have been investigated in a number of
      different domains, very little is known about how children and adults use them in
      chemistry. Here, participants from 4 years to adults saw various mixtures
      presented using a standard property induction paradigm. The category and
      appearance of everyday materials were varied to assess the extent that
      participants use these features to inform their judgments about what happens when
      these materials are mixed with water. In general, the results followed similar
      patterns seen when this paradigm has been applied to other domains, with both
      category and appearance informing inductive generalizations. The findings
      contrast with interview-based measures of children&#8217;s understanding of
      chemistry and offer an important addition to the field.</p>
