	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Concepts of kinds of things (e.g. DOG), have the dual function of
      specifying how to think about indefinitely many things as well as providing the
      means for thinking about a single abstract kind which is constituted by
      indefinitely many instances.  In this talk, I sketch a theory of conceptual
      representation that places this dual function of concepts at its core.  The
      theory is shown to provide a natural way of capturing four key characteristics of
      the ways in which we think about kinds and instances of kinds.  These
      characteristics are not accounted for by standard approaches to conceptual
      representation.  In the final section of the paper, I consider how the phenomena
      discussed in this paper may be accommodated by current approaches to conceptual
      representation. </p>
