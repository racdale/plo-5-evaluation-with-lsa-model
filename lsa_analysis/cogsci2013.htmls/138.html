	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Can our gestures help us think, and, if so, how? Previous work
      suggests that they can. Here, students, alone in a room, studied descriptions of
      environments for later tests of knowledge. The majority of participants
      spontaneously gestured while reading the descriptions, and most of those also
      gestured while answering true-false questions. They did not gesture
      proportionately more time for environments with many landmarks than for
      environments with few. Their gestures laid out the environments, primarily using
      points to places and lines for paths. Descriptions and questions accompanied by
      gestures were remembered more accurately. Participants rarely looked at their
      hands. Gestures seem to promote learning by establishing embodied representations
      of the environments.</p>
