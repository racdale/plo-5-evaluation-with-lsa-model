	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study utilizes a novel task to test two competing
      hypotheses concerning the automaticity of dishonesty. The traditional hypothesis
      claims that in order to act dishonestly one has to first overcome the truth bias,
      which results in more time and effort. The opposing hypothesis indicates that
      lying in order to serve self-interest is an automatic tendency, and therefore
      takes less time than refraining from lying.

      The goal is to look at the action dynamics of dishonesty in order to investigate
      its underlying cognitive processes. Subjects were asked to privately predict the
      outcome of a virtual coin-flip. After observing the actual outcome they reported
      whether their prediction was correct or wrong. The movements of the mouse towards
      the target answer were recorded and used for action dynamic analysis. Our results
      support the latter hypothesis indicating that dishonest people take less time and
      experience less hesitation while choosing the deceptive answer.</p>
