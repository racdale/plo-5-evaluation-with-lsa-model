	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Abstract: One of the promising strains of humanoid robotics is
      that which focuses on explicating and reproducing &#8220;inner&#8221; cognitive
      functions of humans. This approach is motivated by an ambitious aim of realizing
      a human-like mind in a robot. In this general context, we have been working on
      the mechanism of joint attention, the ability of which infants acquire during the
      earlier stage of development. We already succeeded in constructing a robot which
      can engage in joint attention activity of an elementary level.

      In a more matured stage, however, humans ascribe intentions to each other in
      joint attention. In order to realize this process in a robot, it is not
      sufficient for them merely to acquire the ability to follow others&#8217; eye
      direction. Our point is that it is necessary to implement in a robot the relevant
      inferential mechanism which involves an apparatus for emotion-detection and
      object-categorization. In our presentation, we will show how this mechanism can
      work well in our infant-robot.
