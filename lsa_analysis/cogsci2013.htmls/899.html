	<h1>Fixation on Failure: Failing to Solve a Problem Hinders Subsequent Problem-Solving Ability</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study explores how previous experience affects current
      performance. Despite the vast amount of research on transfer and learning effect
      in problem-solving, as far as we know little to no work has been done on how
      failure to solve a problem affects subsequent problem-solving ability. The
      current experiment explores this issue and the role of working memory in the
      process. Two variables were manipulated &#8211; the experienced success or
      failure on a single multiplication problem and the amount of working memory
      resources required by the following addition problem. Results show negative
      impact of failure on subsequent process-time: the problem-solving time for the
      addition problem was higher for participants who failed to solve the
      multiplication problem. There was no interaction between experienced performance
      and the WM resources required by the subsequent problem. These results suggest
      that researchers must probably be careful to avoid fixation on failure as a
      confounding variable.</p>
