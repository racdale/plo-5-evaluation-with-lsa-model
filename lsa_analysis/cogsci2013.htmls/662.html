	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Manipulation of environmental constraints has been shown to
      influence the relative amounts of voluntary and involuntary control employed by a
      person to complete a task, as well as the resulting structure of performance
      variability. Generally, the voluntary control required when no constraints are
      present leads to self-similar changes in performance, some constraint provides
      involuntary control that leads to random fluctuations in performance, and
      constraint which provides feedback about performance accuracy can result in
      anti-persistent variability. The current study investigated whether providing two
      groups of individuals with different intentions for the same task would produce
      changes in voluntary and involuntary control similar to that observed following
      the manipulation of task constraints. Results indicated that a difference in
      intention does result in divergent uses of voluntary and involuntary control and
      distinctly different structures in performance variability.</p>
