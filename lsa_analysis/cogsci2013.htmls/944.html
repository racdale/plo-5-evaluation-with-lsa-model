	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The current study investigated the effect of perspective
      preference on spatial learning. Previous studies revealed that certain factors,
      such as strategies and goals, affect wayfinding behavior and map learning. We
      focused on perspective preference as analyzed through measurement of eye
      movements, which enables us examine potential differences in spatial learning. We
      divided university students into a survey or route preference group through a
      map-learning questionnaire. While participants studied the maps, we measured
      participants&#8217; eye movements to each map element (landmarks, streets, and
      compass rose). After studying a map, participants completed verification tasks
      and wrote their own map of the learned environment. In contrast to our
      prediction, the survey and route groups did not show the difference in regard to
      their gaze to most of the map elements. Although results did not emerge as
      expected, we discuss the effect of perspective preference on map learning and
      memory.</p>
