	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When people communicate in normal environments, they use several
      communication channels, such as the verbal channel, prosody (non-segmental
      aspects of sound) and the visual channel. There is a great variety of views on
      the relative contribution of these channels to the overall understanding of
      messages. Linguists typically limit their interests to the verbal channel alone,
      while social psychologists often emphasize the importance of non-verbal
      components. This study offers an experimental methodology allowing to empirically
      evaluate the contributions of different channels. Two experimental studies are
      reported that used different stimulus material: movies and recorded conversation.
      According to the results of the experiments, all of the communication channels
      are highly significant, the verbal channel being the leading one. Experiment
      participants experienced difficulties in certain unusual conditions, such as the
      combination of the prosodic and visual channels without the verbal component.
      This paper is a contribution to the field of multimodal studies.</p>
