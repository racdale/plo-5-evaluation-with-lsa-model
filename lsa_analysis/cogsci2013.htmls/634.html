	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When we imagine a train snaking through a desert, does information
      about the train&#8217;s speed make it into our visual mental image?  In this
      paper, we make use of the motion aftereffect illusion (MAE) to test whether the
      speed of imagined visual motion modulates transfer of adaptation to a subsequent
      visual motion discrimination task.  We compared the effects of viewing slow,
      medium, and fast motion on the magnitude of the MAE (Experiment 1) with the
      effects of simply imagining the same motion stimuli (Experiment 2). In Experiment
      1 we found that increasing the speed of real visual motion from slow to medium
      produced a corresponding increase in the magnitude of the MAE, but increasing
      speed from medium to fast did not.  Likewise, imagining slow motion produced a
      smaller MAE than did imagining medium motion, but the effect leveled of between
      medium and fast motion.  These findings suggest that our mental imagery of motion
      is specific to the speed of the moving objects, and highlight areas of overlap
      between mental imagery and visual perception. </p>
