	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Representational shifts in memory have been a recent topic of
      interest and debate (Blanco & Gureckis 2012; Lupyan, 2008; Richler, Gauthier &
      Palmeri, 2011; Richler, Palmeri & Gauthier, 2012). Whether there are true
      systematic biases in memory due to a stimulus being labeled has been proposed and
      contested. The fundamental proposal that representations shift toward the
      prototype has not previously been demonstrated. In the present experiment,
      participants judged colored silhouettes by color category or by preference, then
      were asked to remember the hue of the original silhouette among five narrowly
      distinct options. By using the single dimension of hue, we are able to show
      prototypical representational shifts in memory for colored silhouettes after a
      few minutes. We did not observe a difference between color labeled and preference
      judged silhouettes, refuting the claim that labeling is the source of
      prototypical representational shifts.</p>
