	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Wh-words in auditory sentences like "Who/What did Barbie push the
      ___ into?" generate expectations for animacy at the blank (e.g., a filled
      potential Wh-gap). Specifically, the animacy is expected to be opposite of the
      Wh-word ( &#8220;who&#8221; and &#8220;what&#8221; predict inanimate and animate
      nouns, respectively). Fontenau and van der Lely (2008) found Early Left Anterior
      Negativities (ELANs) when animacy matched Wh- animacy in typically developing
      individuals but not individuals with "Grammatical-Specific Language Impairment".
      However, to focus attention on the task, they added final noun phrases to
      violation items ("Who did Barbie push the clown into THE WALL?") but not to
      expected animacy items ("What did Barney push the clown into?"). We ask whether
      participants implicitly learn to predict sentence-final anomalies from animacy
      match. We tested this by presenting one group with the original contingency and
      another with the contingency reversed. Contra the learning hypothesis, we
      observed ELANs for both groups. </p>
