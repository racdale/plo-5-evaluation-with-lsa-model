	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In category-based induction tasks, it is a robust finding that
      positive observations raise the judged likelihood of a conclusion and negative
      observations lower judged likelihood. We present evidence that negative
      observations can raise the judged likelihood. In particular, we asked
      participants to judge the likelihood of a conclusion after introducing them to
      different sets of premises either containing one positive observation or the same
      positive observation and a negative observation. We found that when the negative
      observation is dissimilar to the positive observation, willingness to accept a
      conclusion is raised. Moreover, results from a simultaneous hypothesis generation
      task suggest that the rise in judged conclusion likelihood is due to a peculiar
      shift in the hypothesis space of the reasoner, in that the hypothesis with the
      largest extension, yet still consistent with all premises gains disproportionate
      popularity when introducing dissimilar negative observations.</p>
