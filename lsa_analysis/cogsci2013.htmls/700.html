	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Collaborative remembering is a joint activity that involves the
      establishment and reinforcement of a common ground. In this study, we investigate
      some ways in which collaborative remembering involves interactive coordination of
      non-verbal behaviors. Our data consist of video recordings of small groups of
      people that are reconstructing holiday memories together. For each 500 ms, these
      videos have been annotated in terms of the participants' bodily behavior and
      posture, including variables such as manual gesture, shoulder shrugs, leaning
      direction and gaze. We compared instances of 'simultaneous alignment' (two or
      more people concurrently performing the same behavior) and 'sequential alignment'
      (two people performing the same behavior in short temporal succession) to chance
      baselines, and found that the latter is more common that the former. Our analysis
      furthermore suggests that the degree to which participants coordinate their
      behaviors is stable across the course of the conversation (i.e.,
      time-independent), but connected with specific activities within the larger
      discourse of collaborative remembering.
