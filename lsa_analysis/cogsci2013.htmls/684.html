	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Measuring individual differences in susceptibility to decision
      biases has received increased attention in recent years, yet some methodological
      questions may hinder us from validly assessing the effects of cognitive
      heuristics. Surveys consisting of measures of several biases often aim to compare
      rate of occurrence of these biases and to compile a composite index from these
      measures. Unfortunately, the probability that the participant chooses the
      normative answer on the test questions often varies between and within studies,
      thus confounding the results. Another complication in the surveys used is that
      some incorrect answers are not necessarily the result of the studied bias. In our
      work, we tried to overcome these methodological challenges in a new survey of 15
      cognitive biases. The results of 1127 participants provided insight into several
      methodological and theoretical questions about measuring individual differences
      in heuristic decisions.</p>
