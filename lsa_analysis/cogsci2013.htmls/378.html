	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the way in which working memory (WM) constrains
      the learning of relational concepts &#8211; categories defined by the way objects
      are assigned to roles in the structure of an underlying relation, and not by
      objects&#8217; intrinsic features. By applying to a large sample a novel test of
      concept learning as well as the battery of WM tasks, we found that WM is a strong
      predictor of the scores on the test, but the WM-learning correlation decreases as
      the relational complexity of the to-be-learned concepts increases. Such results
      support those theoretical models of relational learning, which assume that
      learning of relational concepts (and relations, in general) consumes more WM
      resources than just the processing of relations which have already been
      learned.</p>
