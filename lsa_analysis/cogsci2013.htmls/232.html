	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study tested the transfer effects of a short training
      intervention on principled-based self-explanations. The intervention used fables
      and mathematics as "exemplifying" domains for training such self-explanations.
      The effects were tested in a transfer learning environment about attribution
      theory. In this experiment, 58 high-school students were randomly assigned to the
      self-explanation training condition or a control condition (i.e., mnemonic
      strategies). The learning outcomes from the transfer environment did not
      significantly differ between groups. However, those students who reported to have
      applied the strategies from the training intervention actually showed superior
      learning outcomes. The self-explanation training intervention "convinced" just
      part of the learners to engage in principle-based self-explanations. There seems
      to be two options to achieve more reliable effects in the future: The use of
      clearer prompts to employ the learned strategies in the transfer environment or a
      more extended training intervention to have stronger effects on spontaneous
      strategy application.</p>
