	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Human language is characterized by variability in that the way in
      which language is used varies depending, for example, on facts about the identity
      of the speaker or author, the social context, and surrounding linguistic
      material. Variability poses formidable challenges to the systems underlying
      language comprehension, which are known to exploit statistical contingencies in
      the input to overcome the inherent noisiness of perception; nevertheless, we seem
      to comprehend language with apparent ease.  How is this possible?  Here we argue
      that we are able to comprehend language efficiently in part by continuously
      adapting to the statistics of novel linguistic situations.  We argue further that
      adaptation specifically allows comprehenders&#8217; expectations to converge
      towards the actual statistics of the linguistic input.  Concretely, we show that
      readers can adjust their linguistic expectations in light of recent experience
      such that (a) previously difficult structures become easier to process, and, even
      more strikingly, (b) previously easy to process structures come to incur a
      processing cost.  </p>
