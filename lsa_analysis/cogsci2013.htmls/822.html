	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We determined whether verbalization had an effect on lie
      detection. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions:
      the lie condition, the truth condition, or the control condition. They were asked
      to indicate whether the target man was either lying or telling the truth. Prior
      to making their judgments, the participants in the lie condition were required to
      describe some behaviors exhibited by the target individual that indicated that he
      was lying. Similarly, prior to making their judgments, those in the truth
      condition were asked to describe some behaviors exhibited by the target
      individual that indicated that he was telling the truth. The participants in the
      control condition were asked only to make judgments. The participants in the lie
      condition detected lies more often than those in the other two conditions. Thus,
      verbalization influenced lie detection.</p>
