	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present a highly performant, minimally supervised system for
      the challenging task of unconstrained conceptual property extraction (e.g.,
      "banana is fruit", "spoon used for eating"). Our technique employs lightly
      supervised support vector machines to acquire promising features from our corpora
      (Wikipedia and UKWAC) and uses those features to anchor the search for plausible
      unconstrained relations in our corpus. We introduce a novel backing-off method to
      find the most likely relation for each concept/feature pair and produce a number
      of metrics which act as potential indicators of true relations, training our
      system using a stochastic search algorithm to find the optimal reweighting of
      these metrics. We also introduce a human semantic-similarity dataset; our output
      shows a strong correlation with human similarity judgements. Both our gold
      standard comparison and direct human evaluation results improve on those of
      previous approaches, with our human judgements evaluation showing a significant
      20 percentage point performance increase.</p>
