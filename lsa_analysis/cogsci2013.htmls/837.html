	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Numerosity judgment involves determining the number of items,
      which highly correlates with mathematical achievement. This study investigated
      age-related differences on numerosity judgment among middle-level elementary
      students and college students in terms of strategy use and problem-solving
      efficiency determined by participants&#8217; eye movements. Stimuli were grids
      consisting of 7 x 7 units which were either &#8220;on&#8221; (yellow block) or
      &#8220;off&#8221; (blank). Participants were asked to determine the number of
      yellow blocks. 

      Results showed that given energy- and time- consuming, third graders consistently
      adopted &#8220;addition strategy&#8221; on larger numerosity trials. For strategy
      adaptiveness, adults outperformed younger peers, most of whom starting using
      &#8220;subtraction strategy&#8221; on critical and larger trials (e.g., 25 and
      larger numerosities). Regarding efficiency, adults determined numerosities more
      efficiently than elementary students, because adults&#8217; eye fixations were
      significantly fewer than those of younger groups, while only marginal difference
      on the number of fixations was observed for the two younger groups.
