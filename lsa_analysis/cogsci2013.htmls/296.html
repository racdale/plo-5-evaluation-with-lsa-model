	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Frederick&#8217;s (2005) Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is a
      3-item task shown to predict susceptibility to decision-making biases better than
      intelligence measures. It is described as measuring &#8216;cognitive
      reflection&#8217; - a metacognitive trait capturing the degree to which people
      prefer to reflect on answers rather than giving intuitive responses. Herein, we
      ask how much of the CRT&#8217;s success can be explained by assuming it is a test
      of numerical (rather than general) intelligence. Our results show CRT is closely
      related to numerical ability and that its predictive power is limited to biases
      with a numerical basis. Although it may also capture some aspect of a rational
      cognition decision style, it is unrelated to a metacognitive, error-checking and
      inhibition measure. We conclude that the predictive power of the CRT can,
      largely, be explained via numerical ability without the need to posit a separate
      &#8216;cognitive reflection&#8217; trait.</p>
