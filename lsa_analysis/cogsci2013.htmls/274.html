	<h1>A Natural Cure for the Pet Fish Problem: Feature Emergence as Classificatory Composition</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Where do emergent features come from? This has long been an
      intriging puzzle. The concept of pet fish illustrates the
      difficulty. Most people expect pet fish to live in bowls, even
      though this is not something either pets or fish normally do. The
      inference that pet fish have the feature of living in bowls cannot
      be explained purely in terms of the constituents themselves. The
      feature seems to emerge. The present paper aims to explain this
      effect using notions of classificatory composition. Adjoined concept
      references are taken to construct classifications rather than
      combinations; a pet fish is taken to be a fish classified as a pet
      rather than a combination of a pet a fish. It is also shown that,
      where concepts have a compositional representation, feature
      emergence can be accounted for in terms of compositional
      accommodation.
