	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent theory suggests that action prediction relies of a motor
      emulation mechanism that works by mapping observed actions onto the observer
      action system so that predictions can be generated using that same predictive
      mechanisms that underlie action control. This suggests that action prediction may
      be more accurate when there is a more direct mapping between the stimulus and the
      observer. We tested this hypothesis by comparing prediction accuracy for two
      stimulus types. A mannequin stimulus which contained information about the
      effectors used to produce the action and a point stimulus, which contained
      identical dynamic information but no effector information. Prediction was more
      accurate for the mannequin stimulus. However, this effect was dependent on the
      observer having previous experience performing the observed action. This suggests
      that experienced and naive observers might generate predictions in qualitatively
      difference ways, which may relate to the presence of an internal representation
      of the action laid down through action performance.</p>
