	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Current dynamic models of decision-making assume that a unitary
      system is responsible for forming preferences. However, extensive research has
      shown that decision-making and behavior result from the interaction of two
      separate systems of reasoning - one that is fast, automatic, and experiential and
      one that is slow, deliberative and rational. This paper develops the first
      dynamic dual-process model of decision-making that can account for choice,
      response times, and prices. The model is applied to several phenomena from the
      risky decision-making literature including enhancements in preference by small
      losses, preference reversals due to response mode, and the influence of price and
      affect on preference.</p>
