	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In two experiments we study how redundant size modifiers influence
      the perceived size of objects. We show that when objects are referred to with
      overspecified descriptions (for example, using a description like &#8220;the
      large red chair&#8221; in a situation where all chairs are equally large but
      different in color), participants subsequently estimate the object to be larger
      than when objects are referred to using minimally distinguishing descriptions
      (e.g., &#8220;the red chair&#8221;). In Experiment 1, we show this effect with
      adult language users and different kinds of size modifiers. In Experiment 2, the
      same effect is shown for children of two different age groups (7- and 10-year
      olds), and for different kinds of visual size contrasts. Interestingly, we
      observe an inversely proportional relation between the age of our child
      participants and the difference in size estimates for minimal and overspecified
      descriptions, suggesting that language users gradually become better at avoiding
      false pragmatic inferences from redundant adjectives as they grow older.</p>
