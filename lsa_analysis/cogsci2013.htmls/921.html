	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This contribution presents studies currently underway about the
      impact of interactive, digital maps in architectural settings. Google Indoor Maps
      allows users of Android smartphones to identify their position and heading in
      complex public buildings. The study compares participants with and without access
      to such a device. Participants perform both spatial learning and free navigation
      tasks in a building. We evaluate how their wayfinding behavior as well as
      performance on spatial memory measures differs between groups with respect to:
      efficiency, effectiveness on the task; satisfaction and perceived competence with
      both the digital device and the building setting. We further compare groups with
      high vs. low spatial abilities (perspective taking, SBSOD sense of direction) as
      well as different cognitive styles (route vs. survey preference), as expect an
      impact on both strategies of interacting with the device and task success.</p>
