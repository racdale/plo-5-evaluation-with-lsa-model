	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Here we investigated whether hemispheric asymmetry effects can be
      observed in nonconscious processing with a basic-level animal categorization
      (cat/dog) task. We found a significant nonconscious congruency priming effect
      when the prime was presented in the right visual field/left hemisphere but not
      when it was presented in the left visual field/right hemisphere when the prime
      duration was only 10 ms; the left-lateralized congruency priming effect was
      consistent with the left hemisphere superiority in processing abstract category
      information reported in the literature (e.g., Marsolek, 1999). This result thus
      showed that nonconscious processing can go beyond the sensory level to influence
      hemispheric asymmetry in the processing of category information. In contrast,
      this hemispheric difference was not observed when the prime was presented for 50
      ms (nonconscious) or 150 ms (conscious). This effect may be because 10 ms
      subliminal information was insufficient to allow inter-hemispheric
      transfer/processing, allowing the hemispheric difference to emerge. It also
      suggests that hemispheric asymmetry may be better observed at subliminal level.
