	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The ability to learn from others is integral to sustaining and
      transmitting human culture. What are the cognitive processes that support
      imitative and collaborative cultural learning? How does cultural learning
      contribute to group dynamics, such as cohesion and conflict?  Recent research has
      focused on how children acquire instrumental skills through causal inference
      (Call, Carpenter, & Tomasello, 2005; Whiten, McGuigan, Marshall-Pescini, &
      Hopper, 2009).  However, children also need to acquire the norms and conventions
      of their culture, as well as an understanding of cooperative behavior, to become
      full-fledged members of their community.  This acquisition begins early in
      ontogeny and is likely reliant on a unique mix of causal reasoning and
      affiliative goals, triggered by the nature of the action sequence itself and a
      variety of social cues.  In this symposium, we consider the emerging experimental
      literature on the development of imitation and collaboration with the goal of
      applying this work to broader issues of group dynamics and the transmission of
      culture.  Henderson will consider the understanding of collaborative goals in
      infancy.  Kenward will consider the normative basis of young children&#8217;s
      over-imitation.  Watson-Jones will examine affiliative motivations underlying
      children&#8217;s imitation. Whitehouse will consider how ritualized, normative
      behavior and cognition impacts group dynamics of coordination and social
      cohesion.</p>
