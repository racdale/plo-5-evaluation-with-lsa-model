	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Higher working memory capacity (WMC) supports performance on a
      wide variety of complex cognitive and academic activities (Barret, Tugade, &
      Engle, 2004). However, a growing body of research demonstrates that higher WMC
      can have disadvantages&#8212;leading individuals to employ complex performance
      strategies that are less optimal for a given task (cf. DeCaro & Beilock, 2010).
      We examine this possibility in the domain of insight problem solving.
      Participants (N=84) completed Matchstick Arithmetic problems thought to either
      rely on controlled search and retrieval processes (non-insight problems) or
      diverging from known mathematical constraints (insight problems). Consistent with
      a large body of research on WMC, higher WMC was associated with higher
      non-insight problem accuracy. However, higher WMC led to significantly worse
      insight problem-solving. Although higher WMC supports complex problem-solving
      strategies, relying on these may lead individuals to miss associatively-driven
      solutions that are important for insight.</p>
