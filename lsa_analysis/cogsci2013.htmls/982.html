	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Models of decision making neglect the impact of emotions on
      information processing. Here we present  a model of decision strategy selection
      that can account for the differences in the use of two strategies, the
      take-the-best heuristic (TTB) and the Weighted Additive rule (WADD) in a
      probabilistic inference task. How can such a model incorporate emotions? Our
      model assumes attentional weighting of cues, controlled by the activity of locus
      coeruleus  &#8211; a brainstem nucleus associated with physiological arousal.
      Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, the model was evaluated on data from a
      study where participants performed a probabilistic inference task and emotional
      stress was manipulated with highly aversive slides. For each participant we
      estimated the parameter that controls cue weighting. This parameter correlated
      positively with the proportion of choices consistent with TTB and negatively with
      the proportion of choices consistent with WADD. Moreover, this parameter was
      sensitive to the emotional stress manipulation.
