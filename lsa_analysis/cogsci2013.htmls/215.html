	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Questionnaires to assess goal orientation are widely used. 
      However, recent research indicates some shortcomings.  Most significantly,
      questionnaire data are unable to capture developments and changes in
      students&#180; goal orientation during the learning process.  Therefore, it seems
      appropriate to supplement questionnaire data with online measures that directly
      tackle students&#8217; behavior.  We analyzed data of 57 students who
      participated in a study with the Cognitive Tutor Geometry.  Specifically, we
      analyzed relationships between questionnaire data on goal orientation, the use of
      hints and a glossary while working with the Tutor as potential online indicators
      for goal orientation, and learning outcomes.  Results of our analyses show that
      our potential online indicators systematically differ from questionnaire data of
      goal orientation, yet have high predictive power for learning outcomes. 
      Therefore, online indicators may be used to supplement questionnaire data of goal
      orientation and/or to further optimize adaptation in intelligent tutoring
      systems. </p>
