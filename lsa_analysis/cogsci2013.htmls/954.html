	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Despite a vast amount of research, debate continues concerning the
      mechanisms underlying correct use of morphological systems such as the English
      past tense. Relatively little is known about precisely what, when, and how
      children acquire aspects of inflectional morphology due to the paucity of studies
      examining the earliest stages of development, and the generally narrow focus on a
      small number of items and predictors.  To address these problems, we provide
      comprehensive evidence concerning the earliest stages of development. 543
      English-speaking children (196 2-year-olds, 176 3-year-olds, 171 4-year-olds)
      took part in a past tense elicitation task. Responses were elicited for 300 verbs
      (200 for 2-yr-olds) and measures derived (largely from child-directed-speech) for
      a wide range of frequency, phonological and semantic predictor variables. We
      present the outcomes of analyses relating these novel predictor variables to the
      unique behavioural dataset, revealing the cognitive and linguistic underpinnings
      of children&#8217;s early past tense development.   </p>
