	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>While metaphor comprehension deficits were initially reported in
      right hemisphere lesion patients (RHLs), more recent work fails to find such
      deficits. One possibility is that the metalinguistic tasks typically used only
      uncover conscious, controlled comprehension processes. We tested the hypothesis
      that chronic RHLs would show a deficit in a task that taps automatic processes,
      even if their performance on a metalinguistic task was not abnormal.  Nine RHL
      were tested on a sentence/matching-word lexical decision priming task with
      literal and metaphorical sentences and a short SOA. Nine left hemisphere lesion
      patients and thirteen age and education matched healthy adults served as
      controls. A two-way mixed ANOVA revealed a main effect of sentence type (F(1,28)
      = 7.0, p = .01) but no effect of group. All three groups showed larger priming
      effects for literal sentences (M=70ms SD=70ms) than for metaphorical sentences
      (M=34ms, SD=68ms). These data suggest chronic RHLs do not have metaphor
      comprehension deficits even with an automatic processing task. </p>
