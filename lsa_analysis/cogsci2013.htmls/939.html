	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A common view in the judgment and decision making literature is
      that humans posses a repertoire of decision strategies, from which we choose
      adaptively when dealing with decision situations. Modeling this adaptive strategy
      selection process has proved to be difficult, but advances were recently made by
      modeling it as a reinforcement learning process. Dieckmann and Rieskamp (2007)
      investigated the influence of information redundancy in a multiple-cue learning
      setting and found surprising evidence for adaptive strategy selection in
      situations without outcome feedback, which is difficult to explain by a pure
      reinforcement learning model. We challenge these findings by pointing out
      problems in their experimental design. We replicate their experiment, add
      conditions with stricter experimental controls, and investigate possible
      underlying mechanisms. In conditions with stricter controls we find no evidence
      that participants manage to incorporate information redundancy into strategy
      selection and conclude there is no adaptive strategy selection without outcome
      feedback.</p>
