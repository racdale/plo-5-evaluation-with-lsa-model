	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Action recognition is important for social interactions. Because
      little is known about the visual tuning properties of processes involved in
      action recognition, we examined the visual tuning properties of action
      recognition by means of a behavioral adaptation paradigm. Participants were
      adapted to images showing a person hitting or waving and subsequently categorized
      test images showing an ambiguous action as either hitting or waving. We found the
      perception of the test images to be significantly biased away from the adapted
      action (action adaptation aftereffect (AAA)). Subsequent experiments ruled out
      that the AAA was not merely driven by the adaptation of local visual contrast or
      the emotional content of the action. However adaptation to action words (e.g.
      &#8220;hitting&#8221; or &#8220;waving&#8221;) did not induce an AAA. Finally we
      found evidence for the AAA being modulated by the social context in which an
      action is embedded, suggesting high level influences on action recognition. </p>
