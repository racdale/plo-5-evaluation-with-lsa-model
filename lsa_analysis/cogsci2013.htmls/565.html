	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Negation is one of the most important concepts in human language,
      and yet little is known about children&#8217;s ability to comprehend negative
      sentences. In this experiment, we explore how children&#8217;s comprehension of
      negative sentences changes between 2- to 4-year-old children, as well as how
      comprehension is influenced by how negative sentences are used. Children between
      the ages of 2 and 4 years watched a video in which they heard positive and
      negative sentences. Negative sentences, such as &#8220;look at the boy with no
      apples&#8221;, referred either to an absence of a characteristic or an
      alternative characteristic. Older children showed significant improvements in
      speed and accuracy of looks to target. Children showed more difficulty when the
      negative sentence referred to nothing, compared to when it referred to an
      alternative. In addition, children showed an early tendency to look towards the
      named noun, even when that noun was negated. This study contributes to our
      understanding of children&#8217;s comprehension of negative sentences, as well as
      our understanding of the conceptual structure of negation.</p>
