	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Precise walking requires ample cognitive resource to control
      balance in the single leg stance while head moves periodically in the vertical
      axis within each stride cycle. Because visual information is a key factor in
      motor control, we hypothesize that walking alters the allocation of visual
      attention, thereby affecting the selective intake of visual information.
      Participants localized a peripheral dot while identifying the central letter in a
      display during treadmill walking, stepping in place, and standing still. Vertical
      head movement occurred only in the walking condition. Results show that visual
      attention was skewed in the single leg stance during walking and stepping in
      place. Vertical head movement affected the allocation of visual attention because
      only in the walking condition was attention oriented downward without skewing
      during the double leg stance. Cognitive resources and head vertical movement
      appear to work differently in adaptation of visual attention to walking. </p>
