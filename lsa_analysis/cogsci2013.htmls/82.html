	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent studies have shown that the involvement of semantic
      information in visual lexical decision depends on the nature of nonword foils
      with semantic effects increased as nonwords become more word-like (Evans, Lambon
      Ralph &Woollams, 2012). Given that most models of lexical decision focus on
      orthographic information (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon & Ziegler, 2001;
      Grainger & Jacobs, 1996; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989), the role of semantics
      and its interactions with vision, orthography, and phonology has been overlooked.
      We developed a recurrent connectionist model of single word reading including
      visual, orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing. The model
      differentiated words from nonwords by integrating measures of polarity across
      four key processing layers. The contribution of semantics depended on the type of
      nonword foils. The model was more reliant on semantic information when the
      nonword foils were pseudowords and pseudohomophones rather than consonant
      strings. The results support the view that semantic involvement in lexical
      decision is graded by the difficulty of the decision task.</p>
