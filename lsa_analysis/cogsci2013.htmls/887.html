	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The layout of targets is known to affect spatial memory in
      association with special frames of reference. However, most of the previous
      studies have been conducted on the learning from specific viewpoints. The present
      study examines whether the layout, as the structure of special reference points,
      has any effect on special memory when learning from all sides while walking
      around targets. In the experiment, participants explored a virtual circular room
      under the one of two conditions. The objects were arranged like spots on dice. In
      the Square Array, 4 objects were set in a square shape, while in the Node Array,
      one more object was added at the center. After the learning phase, they judged
      the directions of the targets from several imaginary positions of the room. The
      results suggest that the participants in the Node Array made quicker and more
      accurate judgments than those in the Square Array.</p>
