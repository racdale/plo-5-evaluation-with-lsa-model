	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Human adults, infants, and non-human animals are believed to be
      equipped with an Approximate Number System (ANS) supporting non-symbolic
      representations of numerical magnitudes. Recent research has questioned both the
      validity and reliability of tasks intended to measure acuity in the ANS. Issues
      with validity and reliability might be due to differences in methodology. In the
      present study, we compare four tasks designed to measure ANS acuity, using a
      within-subjects design. The tasks are compared with respect to response and
      presentation format effects previously studied in the psychophysics literature,
      but largely ignored in the ANS literature. We find a presentation format effect
      and show that when non-symbolic numerical stimuli are presented sequentially the
      magnitude of the second stimulus is overestimated. Further, the results indicate
      that people&#8217;s sensitivity to differentiate between non-symbolic
      numerosities is dependent on response format. The implications of the results to
      measures of ANS acuity are discussed.</p>
