	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Metacomprehension monitoring accuracy is defined as the ability to
      accurately predict how well one will do on a later test of learned material.
      Metacomprehension monitoring is presumed to be a critical skill for the effective
      self-regulation of study behaviors that impact learning. In two experiments,
      ecologically valid science texts and inference tests were employed to examine
      whether a test expectancy intervention could improve students&#8217;
      metacognitive judgments, self-regulated study, and learning outcomes. Experiment
      1 was a lab experiment in which test expectancies were instilled only after
      reading was complete, thus preventing any encoding effects. Results suggest that
      test expectancies impact metacomprehension monitoring accuracy via selection of
      more valid cues at the time of judgment rather than only via encoding effects
      that impact cue accessibility. Experiment 2 was a classroom study showing that
      the effect of test expectancies on monitoring accuracy translates into more
      effective self-regulated study and improved learning.</p>
