	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cyberbullying is defined as bullying via electronic means
      including the defining characteristics of repetition over time, intent to harm,
      and power imbalance. However, this normative top-down definition is discussed
      controversially. We argue that the term &#8220;cyberbullying&#8221; and the
      associated defining criteria might constrict our focus artificially. Therefore,
      we investigate bottom-up which aspects of cyber cruelty contribute to
      victims&#8217; distress in an adaptive conjoint design with two independent
      samples (sample 1: n = 131; sample 2: n = 82). Six potentially relevant factors
      were investigated, each with multiple attributes: number of incidents,
      perpetrator status, perpetrator motive, and type, medium, and publicity of cyber
      incident. Contrary to the definition of cyberbullying, number of incidents,
      publicity, and type of cyber cruelty emerged as most important factors. These
      results allow us to further map the cognitive representation of cyber cruelty and
      are practically relevant for the definition and measurement of cyberbullying.</p>
