	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Considerable research has demonstrated so-called learned
      categorical perception (CP) effects, where learning to classify a set of stimuli
      leads to either compression (within-category stimuli judged to be more similar
      and/or confusable than before learning) or expansion (between-category stimuli
      judged to be less similar and/or confusable than before learning) or both. The
      issue of why category learning causes one type of effect or the other has not
      been systematically investigated, but previous research suggests that highly
      discriminable stimuli may tend to produce compression while stimuli that are
      difficult to discriminate may tend to produce expansion. We report a series of
      studies testing the effect of stimulus discriminability on the type of learned CP
      effect produced using both similarity and XAB measures of the effects.
      Preliminary results suggest that different measures of categorical perception
      reveal different effects, and that category structure may also be relevant.</p>
