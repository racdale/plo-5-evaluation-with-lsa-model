	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We describe an attempt to understand causal reasoning in
      situations where a binary cause produces a change on a continuous magnitude
      dimension. We consider established theories of binary probabilistic causal
      inference &#8211; &#916;P and Power PC &#8211; and adapt them to continuous
      non-probabilistic outcomes. While &#916;P describes causal strength as the
      difference of effect occurrence between the presence and absence of the cause,
      Power PC normalizes this difference with the effect base-rate to obtain a
      proportional measure of causal power, relative to the maximum possible strength.
      Two experiments compared the applicability of each approach by creating scenarios
      where binary probabilistic scenarios were directly mapped onto inference problems
      involving continuous magnitude dimensions. Results from counterfactual judgments
      tentatively indicate that people reason about causal relations with continuous
      outcomes by adopting a proportional approach when evaluation preventive causal
      powers, and a difference approach in generative scenarios.</p>
