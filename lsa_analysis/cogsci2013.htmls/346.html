	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Instructional analogies can overload children&#8217;s executive
      function and working memory resources (see Richland,
      Morrison & Holyoak, 2006), though structure-mapping lies at
      the core of recommended pedagogy in mathematics
      instruction (National Mathematics Panel, 2008; NRC, 2001).
      Videotaped mathematics instruction was manipulated to test
      the role of visual representations in instructional analogy.
      Pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest measures assessed 11-
      13 year old children&#8217;s learning from one of three versions of
      the same lesson in which three solution strategies (one a
      misconception) were compared. Analogs were either a) Not
      Visible (NV) - presented only orally, b) Partially Visible (PV)
      &#8211; only the most recent solution was visible, or 3) All Visible
      (AV) - all solutions were visible throughout the instruction.
      Overall, AV students experienced greater learning gains in
      procedural knowledge, procedural flexibility, and conceptual/
      schematic knowledge compared to PV students. These results
      persist after one-week delay. Apart from procedural
      knowledge, the same trend is evident when comparing AV
      students&#8217; to NV students&#8217; immediate learning gains. Overall,
      visual representations of analogs within an instructional
      analogy appear to support schema formation only when they
      are all visible simultaneously and throughout structuremapping.
      Showing students visual representations of analogs
      but not enabling them to be simultaneously visible led to the
      lowest performance overall, suggesting this may lead to more
      object-level encoding than schema formation.</p>
