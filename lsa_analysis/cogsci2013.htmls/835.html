	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There is a growing body of evidence that the human brain may be
      organized according to principles of hierarchical predictive coding. A current
      conjecture in neuroscience is that a brain, organized in this way, can
      effectively and efficiently perform genuine Bayesian inferences. Given that many
      forms of cognition seem to be well characterized as Bayesian inferences, this
      conjecture has great import for cognitive science. It suggests that hierarchical
      predictive coding may provide a neurally plausible account of how forms of
      cognition that are modeled as Bayesian inference may be physically implemented in
      the brain. Yet, the jury is still out on whether or not the conjecture is really
      true. In this presentation, we demonstrate that each key sub-computation invoked
      in hierarchical predictive coding potentially hides a computationally intractable
      problem. We furthermore identify ways in which computational modelers may or may
      not overcome these 'intractability hurdles.'</p>
