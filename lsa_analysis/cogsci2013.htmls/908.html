	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Infant language learners are faced with the difficult inductive
      problem of determining how new words map to novel or known objects in their
      environment. Bayesian inference models have been successful at using the sparse
      information available in natural child-directed speech to build candidate
      lexicons and infer speakers' referential intentions. We begin by showing that
      when a Bayesian model is optimized for monolingual input (Frank et al., 2009),
      the model does not sufficiently handle bilingual input, especially as referential
      ambiguity increases. Here we propose an extended Bayesian model that approximates
      infants' mutual exclusivity bias to support the differential demands of
      monolingual and bilingual learning situations. The extended model is assessed
      using corpora of real child-directed speech, showing that performance can be
      optimized for both monolingual and bilingual contexts. We show that including
      both monolingual and bilingual demands in model optimization yields significantly
      different results than when only one context is considered.
