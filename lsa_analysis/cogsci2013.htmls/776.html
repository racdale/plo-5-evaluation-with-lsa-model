	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Creativity is the drive for advancement in many aspects of society
      such as arts, economy, or science. It is unclear if creativity consists of
      several different skills and abilities or if it is one core construct. It is also
      unclear to what extent creativity is influenced by culture and to what extent
      creativity constructs can be generalized across cultures. To investigate these
      questions, we administered three different creativity tests assessing fluency,
      originality, flexibility, and creative achievement to over 900 students in five
      countries: Germany, Guatemala, India, South Africa, and the United States.
      Results showed weak correlations between the different aspects of creativity
      speaking for heterogeneity of different creativity constructs, across all
      cultures. Whereas participants from the five countries did not differ in their
      creative achievements, they differed in the cognitive creativity measures.
      Results are interpreted referring to the eco-cultural context and existing
      cognitive frameworks of creativity.</p>
