	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Reestablishing feelings of control in the face of uncertainty is a
      fundamental motive for human behavior. We propose that rituals (i.e., socially
      stipulated, causally opaque practices) provide a means for coping with the
      aversive feelings associated with randomness due to the perception of a
      connection between ritual action and a desired outcome. Two experiments were
      conducted (one in Brazil [$N=40$] and another in the U.S. [$N=94$]) to evaluate
      how the perceived efficacy of rituals is affected by feelings of randomness. In a
      between-subjects design, the Scramble Sentence Task was used as a priming
      procedure in three conditions (i.e., randomness, negativity, and neutral) and
      participants were then asked to rate the efficacy of rituals used for
      problem-solving purposes. The results demonstrate that priming randomness
      increased participants&#8217; perception of ritual efficacy relative to
      negativity and neutral conditions. Implications for increasing our understanding
      of the relationship between perceived control and ritualistic behavior are
      discussed.</p>
