	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A series of experiments were conducted to examine conceptual
      priming within and across modalities with pictures and environmental sounds. In
      Experiment 1, we developed a new multimodal stimulus set consisting of two
      picture and sound exemplars that represented 80 object items. In Experiments 2
      and 3, we investigated whether categorization of the stimulus items would be
      facilitated by picture and environmental sound primes that were derived from
      different exemplars of the target items. The results demonstrated that the
      categorization of environmental sounds and pictures were facilitated in a similar
      way by conceptually related exemplars presented in advance, but only when a long
      inter-stimulus interval (1000 ms) was used. Additionally, conceptual cross-modal
      priming effects by picture and sound primes were asymmetric with systematic
      switch costs across modalities and with differences in the time-course of
      activation. </p>
