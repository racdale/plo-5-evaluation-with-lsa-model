	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Past research has demonstrated that neighborhood variables (e.g.,
      neighborhood density) influence lexical processing (Andrews, 1989; Vitevitch &
      Luce, 1999), but can have distinct effects for different languages (Vitevitch and
      Stamer, 2006). To explore how neighborhoods can vary both within and across
      multiple languages, we have developed CLEARPOND (the Cross-Linguistic Easy-Access
      Resource for Phonological and Orthographic Neighborhood Densities), a database of
      phonological and orthographic neighborhood information for five languages: Dutch,
      English, French, German, and Spanish. Analyses using the CLEARPOND database
      revealed consistent effects of lexical frequency and word-length on neighborhood
      size across languages, while also highlighting how the languages differed in the
      distribution of neighbor-types (phonological/orthographic). CLEARPOND not only
      provides a tool that can be used to study differences between languages but also
      provides detailed information about characteristics of individual words in
      multiple languages. The CLEARPOND database is freely-available online and can be
      accessed at http://clearpond.northwestern.edu.</p>
