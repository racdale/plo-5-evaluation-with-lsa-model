	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Are observed links between musicality and non-native speech sound
      processing due to superior sensory processing of temporal, pitch, and spectral
      information, which benefits both musical and linguistic processing? Native
      English speakers discriminated Norwegian tonal contrasts, non-linguistic
      pure-tone analogues, Norwegian vowels, and short tones differing in temporal,
      pitch and spectral characteristics. Musicality was measured using Gordon&#8217;s
      (1989) Advanced Measures of Musical Audiation (AMMA). After controlling for
      effects of sex, non-verbal IQ and previous language learning experience, the link
      between AMMA scores and tonal contour discrimination was partially mediated by
      pitch acuity. In addition, tonal contrast, pitch contour and vowel discrimination
      were predicted by temporal and spectral acuity. No independent effects of musical
      training were found. Thus, links between musicality and non-native speech sound
      processing appear to be mainly due to superior temporal, pitch or spectral
      acuity, which, in turn, may play somewhat different roles in processing different
      speech sounds.</p>
