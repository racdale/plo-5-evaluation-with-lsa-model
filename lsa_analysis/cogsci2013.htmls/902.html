	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In psychology, philosophy, and linguistics there has been a debate
      about two competing frameworks of causal reasoning. Dependency theories,
      especially causal Bayes nets, focus on causally motivated statistical or
      counterfactual dependencies between events (causes and effects). In contrast,
      force dynamic theories implement causation as arising (deterministically) from
      force interactions involving agents impinging on the prior tendencies of
      patients. To date force dynamic theories have primarily focused on the
      representation of different semantic causal concepts in scene descriptions. Our
      goal is to bring the two competing frameworks together. We will present a model
      that implements the interaction between agents and patients in terms of
      probabilistic forces. We have tested this new model in an experiment in which we
      tested how contingency information interacts with the assumptions about intrinsic
      tendencies of patients in people&#8217;s usage of semantic causal concepts (e.g.,
      CAUSE, PREVENT, HINDER, HELP, ALLOW, and ENABLE). </p>
