	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Accurate judgments and decisions are crucial for success in many
      areas of human life. The accuracy of a judgment or decision depends largely on
      the cognitive process applied. In research on judgment, decision making, and
      categorization, two kinds of cognitive processes have often been contrasted:
      exemplar-based processes, which use similarity to previously encountered items to
      make judgments, decisions, and categorizations, and rule-based processes, which
      use abstracted cue knowledge. Although most cognitive models of judgment and
      decision processes assume that people rely on both processes, they differ in
      whether they assume that one process is selected or that both processes are
      blended into a single response. The present research takes a functional
      perspective and investigates what kind of interaction between the two processes
      leads to accurate responses. Based on cross- validated simulations in real-world
      domains, it shows that blending rule- and exemplar-based processes generally
      leads to better judgments than does choosing between them, suggesting that the
      default strategy should be a blend of both processes, which is abandoned only
      when feedback justifies it.</p>
