	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent empirical evidence suggests that language-mediated eye gaze
      is partly determined by level of formal literacy training. Huettig, Singh and
      Mishra (2011) showed that high-literate individuals' eye gaze was closely time
      locked to phonological overlap between a spoken target word and items presented
      in a visual display. In contrast, low-literate individuals' eye gaze was not
      related to phonological overlap, but was instead strongly influenced by semantic
      relationships between items. Our present study tests the hypothesis that this
      behavior is an emergent property of an increased ability to extract phonological
      structure from the speech signal, as in the case of high-literates, with
      low-literates more reliant on more coarse grained structure. This hypothesis was
      tested using a neural network model, that integrates linguistic information
      extracted from the speech signal with visual and semantic information within a
      central resource. We demonstrate that contrasts in fixation behavior similar to
      those observed between high and low literates emerge when models are trained on
      speech signals of contrasting granularity.</p>
