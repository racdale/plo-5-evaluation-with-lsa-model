	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Infants demonstrate comprehension of early nouns (e.g.
      &#8220;hand&#8221;) around six months, and comprehension of early non-nouns (e.g.
      &#8220;eat&#8221;) around 10 months. In two experiments, we explore the reasons
      for this lag. Expt. 1 is a gaze-following study, the results of which suggest an
      improvement in point-following around ten months, and reveal correlations between
      pointing and both overall and non-noun vocabulary. Expt. 2 is a set of corpus
      analyses, the results of which suggest that word frequency does not explain the
      difference between noun and non-noun age of acquisition, while suggesting that
      the co-presence of words and their referents may play an important role. The
      results of these experiments contribute to our understanding of word-learning
      across word classes, and lend support to environmental and social factors as
      having an impact on the trajectory of word learning in the first year of
      life.</p>
