	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We study structural properties of a turn-based game called the
      Marble Drop Game, which is an experimental paradigm designed to investigate
      higher-order social reasoning. We show that the cognitive complexity of game
      trials, measured with respect to reaction time, can be predicted by looking at
      the structural properties of the game instances.  In order to do this, we define
      complexity measures of finite dynamic two-player games based on the number of
      alternations between the game players and on the pay-off structure. Our
      predictions of reaction times and reasoning strategies, based on the theoretical
      analysis of complexity of Marble Drop game instances, are compared to subjects'
      actual reaction times. This research illustrates how formal methods of logic and
      computer science can be used to identify the inherent complexity of cognitive
      tasks. Such analyses can be located between Marr's computational and algorithmic
      levels. </p>
