	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent theoretical discussion of dyadic coordination has focused
      on issues of synchronization, entrainment, alignment, and convergence. All of
      these terms refer to matching of specific behavioral and linguistic events, such
      that members of a dyad coordinate by &#8220;doing the same thing.&#8221;
      Communicative behaviors tend to be highly variable, like most human behaviors.
      These tendencies suggest the possibility of complexity matching: Statistical
      measures of behavioral complexity may converge in certain types of dyadic
      interaction. In the present study, acoustic speech signals of interlocutors were
      measured in two conversational conditions, one argumentative and the other
      affiliative. Signal complexity was measured in terms of heavy tails and power
      laws in the distributional and temporal properties of acoustic event series,
      respectively. Parameters of statistical functions were found to vary by
      conversation type, as did their matching between interlocutors. Results
      demonstrate a new way to quantify the coordination of interlocutors in terms of
      complexity matching.</p>
