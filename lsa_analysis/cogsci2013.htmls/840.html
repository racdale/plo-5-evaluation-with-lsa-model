	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>To investigate neural activity with respect to language switching,
      we measured brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      while 5 early Korean-Chinese bilinguals performed a covert property generation
      task with language switching. Forty stimulus photographs of animals and tools
      were presented as stimuli, accompanied by captions written either in Korean or
      Chinese. When the stimuli were shown in Korean, participants were asked to do the
      covert association production task in Chinese (K&gt;C), and vice versa (C&gt;K).
      Results from the fixed effect analysis revealed that the K&gt;C condition (Korean
      as orthographic stimuli and Chinese as semantic execution language) activated
      primarily left precentral gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus while the C&gt;K
      condition activated primarily the region straddling right precuneus and right
      middle/posterior cingulum. These contrasting activation patterns might support
      the hypothesis that the neural representations in language switching tasks hinge
      on the linguistic typology and the cognitive motor control. </p>
