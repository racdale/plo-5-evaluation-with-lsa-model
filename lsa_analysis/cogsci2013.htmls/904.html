	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How do we map joint actions we participate in onto joint actions
      we observe others performing, such as when a couple dancing tango observes
      another couple dancing tango? We investigated this question using a task where
      participants were instructed to perform individual or joint movements in
      synchrony with individual or joint movements observed on a computer screen. The
      observed movements started slowly and then continuously increased in tempo (from
      1.75 Hz to 3 Hz). The results showed that, with regard to spatial parameters,
      joint performance was more accurate when observing joint performance than when
      observing individual performance. Individual performance was more accurate when
      observing individual action than when observing joint action. There were no
      systematic differences with regard to timing parameters. These results suggest
      that mechanisms of temporal coordination may be less susceptible to differences
      between individual and joint action than mechanisms of spatial matching.</p>
