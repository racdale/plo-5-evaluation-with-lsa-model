	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Instruction often employs visual representations to support deep
      understanding. However, students&#8217; prior misconceptions may override the
      meaning in these scaffolds. We investigate fraction bars, a common representation
      intended to promote sense-making. Our prior work found that students often did
      not use the fraction bars effectively. This difficulty factors assessment
      compares four scaffold types: pictures only, two forms of pictures with numbers,
      and numbers only, to assess which interpretation steps were difficult.  On
      equivalence items, students performed equally well with all scaffolds that
      included pictures, but worse with the numbers-only scaffold, indicating that
      fraction bars improved scores for equivalence. However, including numbers with
      the pictures decreased performance for fraction addition. Although students
      demonstrated competence with fraction bars in fraction equivalence, they did not
      transfer this knowledge to addition. These results suggest caution in designing
      and teaching representations for sense-making.</p>
