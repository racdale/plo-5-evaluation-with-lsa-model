	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study investigated the ability of learner-generated
      visualizations to improve learning in science. The hypothesis
      was tested in two domains, a mechanical system and a
      chemical system, and the results were analyzed separately to
      compare low and high spatial ability learners. The production
      of visual explanations of a mechanical system, a bicycle tire
      pump, increased understanding of the pump particularly for
      participants with low spatial ability. In the domain of
      chemical bonding, visual explanations were more effective
      than verbal explanations for all participants. Visual
      explanations often included crucial yet invisible features; their
      accurate construction requires and provides a check for
      completeness of explanations.</p>
