	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Spatial cognition research has recently made much progress in
      understanding the cognitive representations and processes underlying human
      wayfinding. Many theoretical assumptions about the concept of landmark salience
      have been established. In this context it is important to define perceptual (or
      visual) and structural landmark salience. Structural salience is defined as the
      position of a landmark at an intersection. Perceptual salience is defined as the
      visual characteristic of a landmark. It must &#8220;stand out&#8221; from its
      surrounding to be perceptually salient. We investigated the influence of
      perceptual salience and the combination of perceptual and structural salience in
      landmark selection. We show for a spatial arrangement of four objects that the
      different object is preferred almost always. If the same spatial arrangement is
      interpreted as an intersection with a directional information, the
      participants&#8217; preference is influenced by structural as well as perceptual
      salience. Findings are discussed within the context of landmark salience.</p>
