	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>People have generally been considered poor at probabilistic
      reasoning, producing subjective probability estimates that far from accord to
      normative rules. Features of the typical probabilistic reasoning task, however,
      make strong conclusions difficult. The present study, therefore, combines
      research on probabilistic reasoning with research on category learning where
      participants learn base rates and likelihoods in a category-learning task. Later
      they produce estimates of posterior probability based on the learnt
      probabilities. The results show that our participants can produce subjective
      probability estimates that are well calibrated against the normative Bayesian
      probability and are sensitive to base rates. Further, they have accurate
      knowledge of both base rate and means of the categories encountered during
      learning. This indicates that under some conditions people might be better at
      probabilistic reasoning than what could be expected from previous research.</p>
