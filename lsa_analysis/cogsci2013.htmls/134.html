	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Children can learn new words in pedagogical contexts, but they may
      also infer reference using a variety of other information sources. Here we
      investigate children&#8217;s sensitivity to the place- ment of novel labels
      within discourse structure as a possible mechanism for word learning. In
      Experiment 1, children ages 2&#8211;6 years participated in word learning trials
      featuring two novel items and one novel label. In critical trials, the labels
      were embedded between two sentences about the same item, whereas in a control
      condition, the label was introduced after two sentences about the item. Children
      of all ages were more likely to attribute the label to the toy whose descriptions
      brack- eted the embedded label, and response strength increased with age.
      Children across all ages responded at chance in the control condition. In
      Experiment 2, adults showed the same patterns of responses as children in both
      critical and control conditions. Together, these results suggest that discourse
      continuity is a reliable cue to reference for both children and adults.</p>
