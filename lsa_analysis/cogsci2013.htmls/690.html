	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study aims to further our understanding of the social and
      cognitive processes underlying conceptual change learning through argumentative
      discourse. We tested the effect of competitive (vs. collaborative) argumentative
      discourse style and belief of interaction with a human peer (vs. a computerized
      peer agent) on learning the concept of diffusion through interaction with a
      disagreeing peer. Peer confederate&#8217;s verbal behavior was tightly controlled
      to evoke argumentative discourse, holding content exposure constant but differing
      in rhetoric style. Students in the collaborative discourse style condition
      performed better. Moreover even though previous studies have reported that the
      belief of interaction with a human peer benefits learning in consensual settings,
      the opposite was found for a settings in which the partner critiques the
      learner&#8217;s own solutions: Students performed better when they believed they
      interacted with a computer agent (vs. with a human peer). Implications for theory
      as well as task design are discussed.</p>
