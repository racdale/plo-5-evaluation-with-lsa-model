	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A clear, growing consensus indicates an urgent need for humans to
      reduce the burgeoning effects of global climate change (&#8220;global
      warming&#8221; or GW). Apt public instruction seems central to achieving critical
      behavioral changes, but some researchers suggest that U.S. climate attitudes are
      doomed to cognitive stasis (i.e., that little will be gained by educating the
      public). Herein are four studies that counter the stasis view. Our laboratory has
      previously reported findings that (1) virtually no Americans know the basic
      climate change mechanism, yet it (2) is quickly learned (in a few minutes, e.g.,
      with a 400-word text), which (3) increases climate change acceptance. Below,
      Studies 1 and 4 replicate and extend these results to demonstrate (a) efficacy
      with an online presentation and broader populations and (b) retention up to a
      month after learning the mechanism. Studies 2-4 explore roles for germane
      numerical information using estimation with feedback. Study 2 shows that (d)
      misleading, cherry-picked, statistics can decrease climate change acceptance (and
      shake metacognition), while Studies 3 and 4 show that (e) surprising scientific
      information must be presented with care for it to foster beliefs in line with
      climate science&#8217;s consensus. In sum, contrary to unnecessarily pessimistic
      (and correlational) "stasis" arguments, highly germane science information can
      clearly change the public&#8217;s understandings and opinions.</p>
