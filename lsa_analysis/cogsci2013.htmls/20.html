	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In humans, gestural communication is closely intertwined with
      language: adults perform a variety of manual gestures, head movements and body
      postures while they are talking, children use gestures before they start to
      speak, and highly conventionalized sign systems can even replace spoken language.
      Because of this role of gestures for human com-munication, theories of language
      evolution often propose a gestural origin of language. In searching for the
      evolutionary roots of language, a comparative approach is often used to
      investigate whether any precursors to human language are also present in our
      closest relatives, the great apes, because of our shared phylogenetic history.
      Therefore, the aim of this symposium is to present recent progress in the field
      of language evolution from both a developmental and compa-rative perspective and
      to discuss the question if and to what extent a comparison with nonhuman primates
      is suitable to shed light on possible scenarios of language evolution.</p>
