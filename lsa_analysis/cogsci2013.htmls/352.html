	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We formalize the biased activation theory of anchoring using a
      bidirectional associative memory network. Anchors determine the starting state of
      this network. As the network settles, we show that the nodes representing
      numerical responses activate and deactivate consecutively, generating sequential
      adjustment. By demonstrating that anchoring as adjustment emerges naturally from
      the dynamics of the biased activation process, we are able to unify the two main
      theories of the anchoring effect, and subsequently provide a parsimonious
      explanation for a large range of findings regarding anchoring, and its
      determinants. Although we focus largely on phenomena related to anchoring, the
      results of this paper apply equivalently to all judgments under the influence of
      bidirectional processing, including those involving constraint satisfaction.</p>
