	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Individuals are frequently asked to make sacrifices in an attempt
      to produce benefits for future generations.  Such decisions are referred to as
      intergenerational dilemmas.  Previous research on intergenerational dilemmas has
      shown that situational manipulation of factors such as the delay between
      sacrifice and benefits and the perceived similarity with future others modulate
      intergenerational preferences.  However, it is unclear whether there are traits
      that predict intergenerational preferences across a variety of dilemmas. 
      Individual differences were quantified using econometric measures of delay
      discounting and social discounting.  Results indicated that individual
      differences on these measures accounted for a significant portion of the variance
      observed in a broad measure of intergenerational preferences.</p>
