	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the origins of analogical ability in 7-month-old
      infants, using the simplest and most basic relation &#8211; that of sameness and
      difference between two things. Experiment 1 showed infants were unable to detect
      and generalize these relations from a single exemplar (as suggested in Tyrrell et
      al., 1991). Experiment 2 used a habituation-dishabituation paradigm and found
      that infants could generalize the same-different relation to novel objects with
      six to nine training trials. Experiment 3 demonstrated that labels influenced
      performance:
      labeling the relation enhanced performance, but labeling the individual objects
      hindered performance. In addition, we varied infants&#8217; prior experience with
      the objects and found signatures of relational learning have continuity across
      development. In summary, abstraction of relations can be facilitated by
      comparison across exemplars, disrupted by the saliency of individual objects, and
      manipulated by labeling. These findings are discussed in light of recent debates
      about phylogenetic continuity in relational abilities.</p>
