	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present an execution model for manipulation of working memory
      content during intellectual symbolic working memory tasks, which allows random
      access of WM content through a schema-operated sensory-motor spatial working
      memory. The core concept of this framework is binding symbolic items to spatial
      locations which are accessible via selective mechanisms of attention in space. An
      operational schema implements basic WM management operations such as insertion,
      deletion and fetching through sequences of shifts in spatial attention towards
      registry locations. We apply the model to a serial recall task (both forward and
      backward orders). We show that the model provides a better fit to human data in
      backward recall compared to forward recall, which conforms with the evidence for
      leveraging spatial strategies for backward recall and  phonological strategies
      for forward recall in normal subjects. We discuss additional possible
      implications of our model and its assumption of spatial organization of WM
      content and access through shifts of attention.</p>
