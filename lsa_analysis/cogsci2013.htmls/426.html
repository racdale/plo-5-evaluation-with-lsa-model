	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cooperation among children can appear haphazard, a finding often
      attributed to deficient social skills and moral reasoning. Here we took a game
      theoretical approach to understand development of cooperation, using the
      prisoner&#8217;s dilemma to test an alternative source of age-differences in
      cooperative behavior&#8212;how children and adults represent the numerical
      magnitudes of payoffs for cooperating versus not. We found that as incentives
      increased solely in numerical magnitude, speed of incentive comparisons decreased
      and cooperation increased. Further, though children tended to be more cooperative
      than adults, effect of age on cooperation was moderated by speed of incentive
      comparison. We conclude that representations of numeric value constrain how
      economic rewards affect cooperation and that children&#8217;s greater
      cooperativeness may be attributed to a poor sense of numerical value.</p>
