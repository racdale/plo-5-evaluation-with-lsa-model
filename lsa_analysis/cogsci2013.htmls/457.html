	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The goals of this research were to (1) determine if there is
      agreement both amongst viewers, and between viewers and the performer, about the
      extent to which performances are authentic, and (2) ascertain whether or not
      performers and/or viewers can distinguish between authenticity and skill. An
      authentic performance is one that is natural or genuine, while an inauthentic
      performance feels faked, forced, or imitative. Study participants were asked to
      rate the authenticity and skill level of a series of videotaped performances by
      dancers and stand-up comedians. Performers also rated their own performances.
      Authenticity ratings amongst viewers were significantly positively correlated.
      Ratings between viewers and performers were not significant but all positive. A
      higher correlation between ratings of both authenticity and skill of performances
      for viewers than for performers suggests that viewers make less of a distinction
      between authenticity and skill than performers. The relationship between
      authenticity and creativity is discussed. </p>
