	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The English definite and indefinite articles (also known as
      determiners) are a useful index of early morphosyntactic productivity in
      children's speech, and give evidence about children's representation of syntactic
      abstractions. Previous work (i.e. Pine and Lieven, 1997) used a measure of
      productivity that shows a strong sensitivity to sample size and does not account
      for the relationship between adult input and children's learning. In this paper,
      we develop a more robust metric by employing a hierarchical Bayesian model to
      characterize the degree of generalization implicit in observed determiner usage.
      By inferring parameters for a generative model over longitudinal corpora, we
      measure the trajectory of grammatical category abstraction. Our results are
      consistent with the hypothesis that child learners exhibit adult-like patterns of
      generalization quite early in the acquisition of determiners.</p>
