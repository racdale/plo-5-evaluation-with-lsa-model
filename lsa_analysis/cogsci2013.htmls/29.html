	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many grammatical frameworks view words and rules as the basic
      building blocks of language, with multiword sequences being treated as peripheral
      exceptions in the form of idioms, etc.. The new millennium, however, has seen a
      shift toward construing multiword sequences not as linguistic rarities but as
      important building blocks for language acquisition and processing. Based on a
      growing bulk of evidence of sensitivity to multiword sequences in language
      learning and use, multiword sequences have come to figure prominently in many
      current approaches to language, including item-based learning, formulaic
      language, usage-based language processing, and chunk-based learning. This
      symposium brings together experts from these different approaches to language to
      explore the idea that first and second language learners differ with respect to
      their ability to use multiword building blocks to learn and process language, and
      that this difference affects learning strategies and outcomes.</p>
