	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We noticed that human subjects were notably faster and more
      accurate in concurrent counting of three location-based events while they ignored
      the identity of targets, compared to concurrent counting of three identity-based
      events while they ignored the locations. In a control experiment, subjects
      performed a location-based triple counting task, while now also paying attention
      to the target identity. This did not incur any additional cost, compared to the
      cost of the location-based counting. Performing each of these tasks relies on
      maintaining three running numerical counters, and on switching between them to
      increase each one. Our results suggest that switching between these counters has
      lower cost when they are associated to spatial locations, compared to when they
      are associated to identities. This difference is not affected when additionally
      processing the identity of items. We argue that this might be related to the
      advantage of the space in switching attention between internal
      representations.</p>
