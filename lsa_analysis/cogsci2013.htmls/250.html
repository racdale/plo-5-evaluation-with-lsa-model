	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Words divide the world into labeled categories. Languages vary in
      the categories they label, sometimes to the point of making cross-cutting
      divisions of the same space. Previous work suggests two opposing hypotheses about
      how communication contributes to category emergence: 1) these spaces lack an
      objective shared similarity structure, and communication dynamically creates one
      of a number of optimally shareable category structures; 2) the category
      structures resulting from communication are not necessarily optimal, but diverge
      from a shared similarity space in language-specific ways. We had participants
      categorize images drawn from a continuous space in two conditions: a)
      non-communicative, by similarity, b) communicative, dynamically creating
      categories when playing a partnered communication game. The memory demands of
      communication lead to reliance on salient images and early conventions, resulting
      in non-optimal category structures compared to non-communicative participants.
      This supports the hypothesis that communication leads to categories that diverge
      non-optimally from a shared similarity space.</p>
