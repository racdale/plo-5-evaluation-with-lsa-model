	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>With the underrepresentation of minority students in science,
      technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related fields, it is important
      for us to develop ways to narrow this gap. This study examines the use of LEGO
      robotics to increase the interest and motivation of children, particularly
      Hispanic and African-American students. Participants were fifth graders from two
      low SES schools attending an after-school robotics program. Students were
      randomly assigned either learning science in the traditional classroom setting or
      learning science with robotics. The results from this study found that learning
      with LEGO robotics can increase minority students' interest and motivation in
      science and technology.</p>
