	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Mathematics anxiety negatively affects performance in simple
      arithmetic tasks. The experiment reported here explored the role of interactivity
      in defusing the impact of math anxiety on mental arithmetic. Participants were
      invited to complete additions presented on paper without using their hands or any
      artefact; in a second, interactive, condition, the same problems were presented
      in the form of a set of manipulable tokens. Math anxiety was significantly
      correlated with mental arithmetic performance only in the static condition. The
      results of a mediation analysis indicated that the effect of math anxiety on
      mental arithmetic was mediated by working memory capacity in the static
      condition; in the interactive condition, math anxiety and working memory did not
      significantly correlate with performance. Interactivity encouraged the coupling
      of internal and external resources to create a cognitive system that augmented
      and transformed working memory capacity, diffusing the resource drain caused by
      math anxiety.</p>
