	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Individuals experience a redundancy gain when they respond faster
      to two signals than one. This benefit can derive from statistical facilitation of
      independent decisions (Raab 1962) or from the co-activation of signals before a
      decision (Miller, 1982). Here we applied these tests to the redundancy gain that
      occurs when pairs of participants work together to detect targets. We also
      compared gains when each partner was responsible for one of two targets versus a
      different spatial region. The results showed pairs were more efficient than
      individuals, and that this gain was greater when the task was divided by target
      identity versus by space. We also found that the collaborative redundancy gain
      could be characterized as co-activation, meaning that the benefit of
      collaboration exceeded that predicted by statistical facilitation. These results
      serve as a proof of concept that models developed to understand information
      processing in individuals can help characterize collaborative performances.</p>
