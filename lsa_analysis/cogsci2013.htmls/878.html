	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Actions in joint tasks are affected by the way the partner is
      acting. As action planning is mediated by an anticipation of their sensory
      consequences, this influence is likely to encompass the expected reactions of
      others to one's own actions. If so, it should be easier to perform actions that
      trigger compatible partner reactions instead of incompatible ones. To test this,
      we used a spatial action-effect compatibility paradigm in a joint task. Subjects
      moved virtual objects to different locations on a multi-touch table, followed by
      either a partner's manual reactions on the same or another object, or by
      automatic visual effects. There was a tendency for faster performance of actions
      with compatible effects, and no interaction with effect type. However, for the
      joint condition alone, no reliable compatibility benefit was found. The results
      highlight several difficulties in applying the basic research on ideomotor action
      control to more naturalistic, joint tasks.</p>
