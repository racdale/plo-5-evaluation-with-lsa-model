	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Although it is well established that regions of ventral premotor
      cortex (vPMC) are active during action observation, it remains
      controversial whether that activation plays a causal role in action
      interpretation. In the experiment reported here, we used offline
      continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to investigate this
      question. All participants received offline cTBS to the hand area of
      vPMC in one session and to the lip area in a separate session, and
      after each session performed an action-interpretation task in which
      half of the trials were pantomimed hand actions and half were
      pantomimed mouth actions. The results show that participants
      were less accurate in interpreting hand actions after receiving
      cTBS over the hand area than after receiving stimulation over the
      lip area, and less accurate at interpreting lip actions after receiving
      cTBS over the lip area than after receiving stimulation over the
      hand area. This double dissociation provides evidence in support of
      the claim that somatotopically organized regions of vPMC
      contribute causally to action interpretation, and the claim that
      action production and action interpretation rely on overlapping
      mechanisms. In more general terms, they reveal an involvement of
      the motor system in more sophisticated cognitive processes than
      has hitherto been demonstrated.</p>
