	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The effect of minimally counterintuitive information on memory is
      well established.  However, less work has addressed the processing of maximally
      counterintuitive stories (i.e., stories containing at least three domain
      violations).  The current study examined memory for maximally counterintuitive
      stories.  The first two experiments investigated whether explicit instruction to
      make sense of &#8220;strange information&#8221; influenced memory for maximally
      counterintuitive stories.  Although no such effect was observed, post hoc
      analyses indicated that the extent to which concepts in maximally
      counterintuitive stories contained domain violations from similar or different
      categories influenced memory performance; stories with similar domain violations
      enjoyed a memory advantage.  The third study addressed the believability of
      concepts with similar domain violations with a rating task.  Participants were
      more likely to agree with two counterintuitive concepts with similar domain
      violations compared to a single counterintuitive concept.  The results are
      discussed within Upal's (2005; 2009) context-based view of memory for
      counterintuitive ideas.</p>
