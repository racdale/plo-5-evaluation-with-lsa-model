	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Decision making is a dynamic process. Alternatives compete over
      time, and this competition plays out in sensorimotor processes. This is true not
      just for perceptual decisions or simple categorisation tasks, but also for moral
      decisions, which are the outcome of a complex interplay of intuition, emotion and
      reasoning. In this experiment, we first establish a descriptive and causal link
      between gaze and moral judgement. We then use eye movements to track the time
      course of participants&#8217; moral decisions and show that by interrupting their
      decision process based on their gaze position, we are able to influence what they
      decide. We interpret this as evidence for a dynamical systems view of decision
      making and argue that our results provide new insights into how judgements are
      reached and constructed in our embodied minds.</p>
