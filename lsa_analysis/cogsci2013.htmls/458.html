	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Tutoring gives tutors the opportunity to engage in interactive
      strategies that help them to assess a tutee&#8217;s understanding. However,
      tutors without teaching experience often do not engage in interactive strategies
      and, thus, have difficulty with accurately assessing a tutee&#8217;s
      understanding. We conducted an experiment with 39 tutor-tutee dyads to test
      whether tutors who received training in interactive strategies would become more
      interactive and more accurate in assessing a tutee&#8217;s understanding. Results
      showed that trained tutors provided a more interactive style of tutoring than
      untrained tutors. However, due to being more interactive, trained tutors produced
      less accurate assessments than untrained tutors. This suggests that changing the
      style of tutoring to implement interactive strategies puts a high burden on a
      tutor&#8217;s cognitive capacity. Hence, there is obviously little cognitive
      capacity left that could be used to assess a tutee&#8217;s understanding.
      Training methods that automate strategy use might enhance a tutor&#8217;s
      assessment accuracy.</p>
