	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Creative reasoning in ill-defined problem spaces operates
      differently from classical reasoning in well-defined spaces. To systematically
      compare the two in an identical knowledge domain, we applied a classical
      intelligence test: the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), in combination with
      two tests of creativity: the Test for Creative Thinking - Drawing Production
      (TCT-DP) and the newly developed Creative Reasoning Task (CRT), in which
      participants are asked to create an SPM-like item, to two age groups (N1 = 511,
      4-12y old; N2 = 205, 6-10y old). For SPM and CRT the knowledge domain consists of
      relationships amongst geometrical components in 3 x 3 matrices. We developed a
      typology for scoring the number and complexity of the relationships used in these
      matrices. For the SPM, we scored frequencies of relationships solved and for CRT
      those created, and interpreted the scores in terms of differences and
      similarities between classical and creative reasoning in cognitive
      development.</p>
