	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Spatial congruity effects are often interpreted as evidence for
      metaphorical thinking, but an alternative markedness-based account challenges
      this view. Here, we compared metaphor and markedness explanations for spatial
      congruity effects, using musical pitch as a testbed. English speakers who talk
      about pitch in terms of spatial height were tested in space-pitch compatibility
      tasks. To determine whether congruency effects could be elicited by any marked
      spatial continuum, participants classified pitches as 'high' and 'low' or as
      'front' and 'back' (both pairs of terms represent marked continuums). We found
      congruency effects in high/low conditions but not in front/back conditions,
      indicating that markedness cannot explain congruity effects. A second experiment
      showed that congruency effects were specific to spatial words that cued a
      vertical schema (tall/short), and that congruity effects were not based on
      polysemy (e.g., 'high' referring both to space and pitch). Together, these
      results suggest that congruency effects reveal metaphors, not markedness.</p>
