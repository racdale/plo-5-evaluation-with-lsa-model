	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Gaze behavior provides fundamental mechanisms for sharing mental
      states
      such as goals and desires and helps to ground communicative content.
      Responding to or leading someone's gaze to a location or an object of
      interest thus may result in a situation of joint attention -- a
      referential triad between two individuals and an entity in the
      environment. Since people often look at what they attend to and where
      they intend to act, joint attention is considered fundamental to an
      understanding of other minds and the interaction with them.
      This workshop aims to explore how traditionally separate research areas
      such as social cognition/neuroscience, psycholinguistics, human-computer
      interaction and developmental psychology contribute to an understanding
      of the general phenomenon of gaze-following and joint attention from
      different perspectives -- and how these fields can benefit and learn
      from each other, e.g. by comparing different approaches and methodologies. </p>
