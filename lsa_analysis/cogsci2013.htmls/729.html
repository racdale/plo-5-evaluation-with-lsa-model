	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) lag behind peers
      with typical language (TL) in vocabulary. We ask what impact this lag has on
      shape bias (generalization based on shape in Naming contexts [&#8220;here&#8217;s
      a dax; find another dax&#8221;] but not Classification contexts [&#8220;look at
      this; find another like this&#8221;). Smith (2000) argues that shape bias depends
      on and drives vocabulary development; vocabulary is a basis for detecting
      covariation between objects and names, and name learning accelerates once the
      bias emerges. 51 three and four year-old children (16 SLI, 16 matched TL, 19
      additional TL) participated in Naming and Classification tasks, a paired visual
      association (PVA) task, and an assessment battery. The SLI group was
      significantly worse at PVA and did not exhibit a shape bias. Individual
      differences revealed wide variation in both groups, and that shape choices in
      Naming were better predicted by PVA than standardized assessments.</p>
