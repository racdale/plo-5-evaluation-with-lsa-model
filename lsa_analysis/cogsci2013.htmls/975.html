	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In the last decade, numerous studies in inductive reasoning have
      shown that people are remarkably quick at picking up the relevant features that
      allow generalizations. One formal account of (some instances of) cases where this
      ability emerges, relies on the assumptions people make about the manner in which
      the observations are sampled from the world. According to a weak sampling scheme,
      observations are randomly drawn from the environment. However, a reasoner can
      also assume that the observations are sampled deliberately from the intended
      hypothesis (strong sampling). In the present contribution, we compare these
      assumptions in a inductive reasoning task using semantic stimuli from 4
      superordinate concepts (animals, clothes, vehicles,musical instruments). Model
      analyses are performed to examine the sampling assumptions of reasoners in this
      context. We find that people generally assume a strong sampling scheme. However,
      the model seems to underestimate the relevance sensitivity of the
      participants.</p>
