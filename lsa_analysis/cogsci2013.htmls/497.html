	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We directly compared the effectiveness of a spelling intervention
      focused on morphological structure with one that emphasized the meanings of
      complex words, to differentiate their relative contributions to spelling
      acquisition in grade 3 and grade 5. We found that the morphology intervention
      provided a greater improvement than the vocabulary intervention, especially for
      children in grade 5. To compare the long-term effects of the two interventions,
      we tested the children&#8217;s spelling ability six-months after the conclusion
      of the intervention program. Results show that both grades maintain an increase
      in spelling accuracy compared to their pre-intervention performance.
      Additionally, the children in grade 5 who received morphological instruction
      retained more spelling knowledge than those who received the vocabulary
      instruction. These results suggest that teaching children about the structure of
      complex words supports their spelling ability in the long-term, providing
      evidence for the important role of morphological knowledge in literacy
      development.</p>
