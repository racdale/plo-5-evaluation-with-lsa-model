	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examined the hypothesis that individuals with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show a selective deficit in inductive
      reasoning but are unimpaired in their ability to make deductive inferences. 100
      participants from an analog sample made inductive or deductive inferences about
      arguments that differed according to causal consistency and validity. They also
      completed a task examining sensitivity to the implications of diverse evidence in
      induction. Participants who were high or low on obsessive-compulsive symptoms
      showed similar patterns of induction based on causal knowledge and similar
      patterns of deduction. However, those with the highest level of OCD symptoms
      showed less of a preference for diverse evidence when evaluating inductive
      arguments, compared to those with the lowest level of symptoms. This difference
      was found across both OCD-relevant and OCD-neutral items, and persisted when the
      effects of group differences in general ability were controlled. These results
      indicate that both inductive reasoning based on background knowledge and
      deductive reasoning are intact in individuals with high OCD-traits but the use of
      inductive heuristics such as evidence diversity is impaired.</p>
