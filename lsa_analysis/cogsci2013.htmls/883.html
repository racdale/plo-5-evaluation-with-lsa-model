	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When two individuals engage in their tasks with a common stimulus
      display, the partner&#8217;s presence, response, task, and/or focus of attention
      often affects one&#8217;s own task performance. The present study investigates
      how the partner&#8217;s task affects one&#8217;s own task performance when one of
      two adjacently sitting participants engages in location-relevant task and the
      other in location-irrelevant task, with a common stimulus display and separate
      response sets. The target appeared at left or right. One participant pressed a
      left or right button according to the color of the target when it was green or
      red. The other participant pressed a left or right button of another response set
      according to the location of the target when it was white. Although the spatial
      compatibility effects were observed within each task, no cross-task (i.e.,
      cross-participant) interference was observed. Results are discussed in terms of
      what is co-represented in joint task settings.</p>
