	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>An expression style refers the graphical or phonological style of
      language. (i.e., letters or phonemes in words). In daily life, typographies or
      prosodies are often made to harmonize its connotative meanings with words&#8217;
      meanings they convey. To investigate the role of these harmonization, we
      demonstrated previously that the harmonization between words&#8217; meaning and
      the typography at encoding had effects on implicit memory in the visual
      word-fragment completion task (WFC), which implied that harmonization facilitated
      visual processing of presented words. Expecting that harmonization in sound and
      word&#8217;s meaning has same effects, we conducted another experiment, which
      manipulating the harmonization between words&#8217; meaning and their prosody in
      utterance, using an auditory and visual (classical) WFC. The results showed no
      effects of harmonization. These results suggest that typography in visual
      processing and prosody in auditory processing had different function in their
      connotative meanings. </p>
