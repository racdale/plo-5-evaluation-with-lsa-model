	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How do we assign causal responsibility for others&#8217;
      decisions? The present experiments examine the possibility that an optimality
      constraint is used in these attributions, with agents considered less responsible
      for outcomes when the decisions that led to those outcomes were suboptimal. Our
      first two experiments investigate scenarios in which agents are choosing among
      multiple options, varying the efficacy of the forsaken alternatives to examine
      the role of optimality in attributing responsibility. Experiment 3 tests whether
      optimality considerations also play a role in attribution of causality more
      generally. Taken together, these studies indicate that optimality constraints are
      used in lay decision theory and in causal judgment.</p>
