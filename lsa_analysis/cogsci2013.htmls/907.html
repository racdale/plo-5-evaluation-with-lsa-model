	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In the picture-word interference paradigm low-frequency words have
      been shown to induce longer naming times, and thus more interference, than
      high-frequency words. In this study we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to
      explore the time course and locus of frequency effects within the language
      production system. Furthermore, we tested whether frequency effects are related
      to non-lexical variables such as valence and arousal. We presented pictures and
      superimposed high and low-frequency distractors and additionally varied the
      emotional valence and arousal of the distractor words. The effects of distractor
      frequency in naming times and ERPs - starting at about 300 ms - were modulated by
      arousal, suggesting that non-lexical mechanisms can modulate distractor effects
      in the picture-word interference paradigm. </p>
