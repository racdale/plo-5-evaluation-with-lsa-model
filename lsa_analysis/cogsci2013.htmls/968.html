	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Parallel
      Distributed Processing (PDP) approach to cognitive modeling is that
      representations are distributed across a large set of units. However, this is not
      always the case. In a series of simulations we show that PDP neural networks tend
      to form localist representations under certain conditions. First, localist
      representations are developed when the mapping between the input and output
      patterns is arbitrary. A second pressure to learn localist codes comes from
      having to keep multiple representations active at the same time. Introducing
      biologically plausible constraints on the network architecture also fosters
      developing local codes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
      widespread assumption that PDP neural networks learn distributed representations
      is often wrong. Moreover, exploring the computational reasons for which PDP learn
      localist representations provides insight into why selective neurons are often
      found in the brain. </p>
