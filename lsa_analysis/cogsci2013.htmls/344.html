	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent evidence shows tense-response compatibility effects only
      when the task relates to sentence tense (Ulrich & Maienborn, 2010). In two
      eye-tracking experiments, we investigated tense-response compatibility effects.
      In our first experiment (E1, where sentence tense was relevant to the task) we
      found compatibility effects at the beginning of the sentence (e.g., Yesterday
      versus Tomorrow), which shifted to interference effects by sentence end. Overall,
      we also found compatibility effects in response times, replicating Ulrich and
      Maienborn. Both compatibility effects in Experiment 1 (E1) were stronger for low-
      compared to high-WM readers. In Experiment 2 (E2, where tense was irrelevant), we
      found compatibility effects for high-WM readers, but only in early reading
      measures. These results suggest that compatibility effects are weaker depending
      on the task, but not eliminated; an implication which may help refine a strict
      view of embodied cognition.</p>
