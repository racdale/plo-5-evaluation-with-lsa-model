	<h1>On The Possibility of an Extended, Yet Reductionist Mind</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In the debate around the extended mind, the special alliance that
      the extended thesis often has with functionalism usually plays in favor of the
      former, with functionalism providing support for the extended thesis. Here I want
      to consider this alliance in the opposite direction: does the extended thesis
      provide support for functionalism by promoting the need of a level of explanation
      that is independent of implementational (in particular neural) details? In spite
      of a seemingly promising line of reasoning for an affirmative answer, I show here
      that a commitment to the extended thesis or any version of externalism neither
      paves the way for a functionalist (or any other anti-reductionist) position nor
      is incompatible with an explanatory reductionism about the mind. I arrive to that
      conclusion after analyzing an argument by van Eck et al. (2006) meant to conclude
      the opposite, and showing why it is unsound.</p>
