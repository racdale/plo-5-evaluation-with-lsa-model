	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the roles of comparison and explanation in
      teaching children an important engineering principle &#8211; that triangular
      cross-bracing confers stability to structures. We aimed to discover how best to
      convey this principle to 4- and 6-year-olds and to reveal the cognitive
      mechanisms involved. Children either compared contrastive cases (a braced
      building vs. a non-braced building), received an explanation of the principle, or
      both, and were then tested on their ability to apply the principle to various
      contexts. We found that 4-year-olds benefited from comparison, but surprisingly
      did not benefit from a combination of comparison and explanation. 6-year-olds,
      however, benefited greatly from the combination, suggesting that more developed
      abilities are required to combine the two inputs. Performance on a mental
      transformation task was also related to successful brace placement. These
      findings suggest that comparison and explanation can both contribute to learning,
      both singly and together, depending on ability and/or age.</p>
