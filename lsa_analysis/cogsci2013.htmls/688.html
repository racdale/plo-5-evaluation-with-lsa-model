	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Systems contain normal noises even in a stable state, but larger
      noises in an uncontrollable state. In this study, we investigated different
      responses between experts and novices in controllability judgment. A half
      participant was required to discriminate variance magnitude of two sound tone
      sequences (standard vs. comparison). The sequence consisted of 16 tones whose
      pitch contained Gaussian noises. They continued to train the variance
      discrimination task up to a criterion level, and were regarded as experts. Then,
      the experts and novices participated in the controllability judgment task (i.e. a
      kind of the risk judgment task) with use of similar stimuli in the discrimination
      task. They were allowed to continue to judge for gain whether they were in an
      uncontrollably higher risk state with larger variances. They could stop the trial
      to make smaller costs. Our results showed experts in the discrimination task
      increased avoidance responses more than novices.</p>
