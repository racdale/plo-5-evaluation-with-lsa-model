	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper investigates the role of the assumption of
      class-conditional independence of object features in human
      classification learning. This assumption holds that object feature values are
      statistically independent of each other, given knowledge of
      the object's true category. Treating features as class-conditionally independent
      can in many situations substantially facilitate learning and categorization even
      if the assumption is not perfectly true. Using optimal experimental design
      principles, we designed a task to test whether
      people have this default assumption when learning to categorize. Results provide
      some supporting evidence, although the data
      are mixed. What is clear is that classification behavior adapts to the structure
      of the environment: a category structure that is unlearnable under the assumption
      of class-conditional independence is learned by all participants.</p>
