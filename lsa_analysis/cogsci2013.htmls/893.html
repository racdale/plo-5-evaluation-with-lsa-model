	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previously, we investigated the distribution of instances of
      early-learned object-based categories in toddler&#8217;s realistic everyday
      learning episodes; we found important differences in terms of frequency and
      variability (3D vs. 2D; real object vs. realistic toy vs. simple shape).

      Using a picture book task we tested 24-36 month olds&#8217; recognition of these
      categories in four conditions: Realistic; Features (only parts of the photo
      visible); Silhouettes; and Geons (a shape caricature version made with only 3-4
      parts and no color or texture). Results show similar recognition for all
      Realistic and Silhouette versions; Geons were lower than the first two; and
      Features had the lowest recognition rate. Critically, categories with the highest
      variability in our previous study were readily recognized by Features but
      difficult to recognize in Geon version. These results suggest that abstracting
      global shape is influenced by the specific trajectory of experienced
      exemplars.</p>
