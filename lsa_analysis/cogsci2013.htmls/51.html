	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When listening to music, we form implicit expectations about the
      forthcoming temporal sequence. Listeners acquire knowledge of music through
      processes such as statistical learning, but how do different types of statistical
      information affect listeners&#8217; learning and memory? To investigate this, we
      conducted a behavioral study in which participants repeatedly heard tone
      sequences varying within a range of information-theoretic measures. Expectedness
      ratings of tones were collected during three listening sessions, and a
      recognition memory test was given after each session. This enabled us to examine
      how statistical information affects expectation and memory for tone sequences
      over a period of increasing exposure. We found significant correlations between
      listeners&#8217; expectedness ratings and measures of information theory (IT),
      and although listeners demonstrated poor overall memory performance, the IT
      properties significantly impacted on musical memory. Generally, simple sequences
      yielded increasingly better memory performance. High-information sequences, for
      which making accurate predictions is difficult, resulted in consistently poor
      recognition memory.</p>
