	<h1>Belief Bias in the Perception of Sample Size Adequacy</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In two experiments, participants were instructed to set aside
      their complete knowledge of a statistical population parameter and to take the
      perspective of an agent whose knowledge was limited to a random sample.
      Participants rated the appropriateness of the agent's conclusion about the
      adequacy of the sample size (which, objectively, was more than adequate), along
      with the agent's intelligence. Whereas previous work suggests that unbelievable
      statistical conclusions impact reasoning by provoking critical thought which
      enhances the detection of research flaws, the present studies presented
      participants an unflawed scenario designed to assess effects of believability on
      bias. The results included the finding that participants' complete knowledge
      indeed biased their perceptions not only of the adequacy of the sample size, but
      also of the rationality of the agent drawing the conclusion from the sample. The
      findings were interpreted in the context of research on belief bias, social
      attribution, and Theory of Mind. </p>
