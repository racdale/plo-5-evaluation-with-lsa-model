	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present a biologically based neural model capable of performing
      reinforcement learning in complex tasks.  The model is unique in its ability to
      solve tasks that require the agent to make a sequence of unrewarded actions in
      order to reach the goal, in an environment where there are unknown and variable
      time delays between actions, state transitions, and rewards.  Specifically, this
      is the first neural model of reinforcement learning able to function within a
      Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) framework.  We believe that this extension of
      current modelling efforts lays the groundwork for increasingly sophisticated
      models of human decision making.</p>
