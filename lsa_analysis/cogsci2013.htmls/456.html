	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>To act efficiently in the classroom, teachers need to be able to
      judge the difficulty of problems from a novice&#8217;s perspective. However,
      research suggests that experts use their own knowledge as an anchor, adjust
      estimations for others to their own knowledge and thus underestimate the
      difficulty that a problem may impose on novices. Similarly, experts should
      underestimate the benefit for novices of task designs derived from Cognitive Load
      Theory (CLT), as &#8211; following the expertise reversal effect &#8211; these
      should be rather disadvantageous for experts. We investigated pre-service and
      in-service teachers&#8217; competencies in estimating the difficulty of
      mathematical tasks for novices. Thirty-four pre-service teachers and thirteen
      experienced teachers solved tasks that varied in instructional design (optimized
      for novices following CLT versus non-optimized). Participants solved each task
      and then estimated how many students of a fictional 9th grade class would be able
      to solve that task. Solution frequencies were collected from fifty-two 9th grade
      students. In both expert groups, overestimation was clearly more pronounced for
      non-optimized than optimized tasks, suggesting an expert blind spot that can be
      explained in terms of an expertise-reversal effect. The experts failed to
      adequately take into account the benefits of didactic task variation for novice
      learners. However, whereas pre-service teachers&#8217; overestimations of student
      performance were large and significant both for non-optimized and optimized
      tasks, in-service teachers&#8217; overestimations were generally small and failed
      to approach statistical significance. In contrast to pre-service teachers,
      in-service teachers seem to have a better mental model of what a student is able
      to achieve, thus making better judgments of student performance.</p>
