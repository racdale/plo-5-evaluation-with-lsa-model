	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>New theories of cognition posit the existence of an intimate link
      between higher cognitive processes and the sensorimotor areas of the brain. In a
      reaction time-based translation task, second language (L2) speakers responded to
      action verbs using a microphone or a response pad. A significant interaction
      among Response Modality, Verb Type, and Proficiency indicated that more
      proficient L2 speakers took significantly longer to respond with their hands to
      previously seen hand-related verbs, but not mouth-related ones. Conversely,
      responding using a microphone led to slower latencies in the case of mouth-verbs,
      but not hand-verbs. Amidst virtually exclusively monolingual research on embodied
      cognition, the current study provides evidence that reading L2 action verbs
      selectively interferes with subsequently performed manual or verbal responses,
      suggesting that semantic representations of these verbs are distributed over
      neural substrates underlying action execution. The role of proficiency and
      experience in language comprehension is discussed.</p>
