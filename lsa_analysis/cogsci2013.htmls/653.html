	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigate the amount of speech and (co-speech) gestures
      addressed to infants at 1;1 years of age in rural and urban Mozambique, and
      correlate these amounts with vocabulary size measured at 1;5 and 2;1. We found
      that urban infants are exposed to more than three times as much speech and
      co-speech gestures than rural infants. The results show that the amounts of
      co-speech gestures and speech predict later vocabulary development in the urban
      community, but not in the rural community. The results further show that rural
      infants are delayed in their vocabulary development, which may in part be
      explained by a transition in the socialization style rural infants experience
      between the age of 1;1 and 1;5. </p>
