	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Emotion perception is not only influenced by the ethnic
      group-membership of interaction partners but also depends on whether a person is
      engaged with the encoder of an emotion. To characterize the neural correlates of
      the influence of ethnicity and engagement on emotion perception, German
      participants rated the valence of video-sequences while undergoing fMRI. In these
      video-sequences Asian-looking and European-looking virtual characters expressed a
      positive (happiness) and a negative (anger) emotion while either gazing directly
      at the participants or at another agent, thereby varying the perception of
      engagement. Results show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is involved when
      participants observe ethnic in-group members compared to ethnic out-group members
      express a positive emotion at them compared to at another person. In contrast,
      the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are involved when participants
      observe ethnic out-group members compared to ethnic in-group members express a
      negative emotion at them compared to at another person. </p>
