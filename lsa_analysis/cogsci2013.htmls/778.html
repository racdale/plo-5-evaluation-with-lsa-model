	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How do people learn underlying properties, such as mass and
      friction, from objects' interactions in complex scenes? Such inferences are
      difficult: the parameters cannot be directly observed and have nonlinear effects
      on the physical dynamics. Yet, people learn them. Participants predicted the
      stability of blocks stacked in complex tower configurations. After observing the
      true outcome, they answered, "which blocks are heavier?". Their responses
      indicate rapid learning of the blocks' relative masses. We view such learning as
      probabilistic inference in a generative model of Newtonian rigid-body dynamics,
      and express this hypothesis in a model observer that infers parameters using a
      procedure of approximate physical simulation. While participants' judgments
      qualitatively matched the model's, they also deviated in key ways that may be
      explained by resource limitations. This work advances our understanding of how
      people infer unobserved physical properties, and offers a framework for modeling
      such behavior in complex, real-world scenes.</p>
