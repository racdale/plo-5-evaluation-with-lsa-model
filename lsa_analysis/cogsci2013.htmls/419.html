	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>For both human and machine learners, it is a challenge to make
      high-level sense of observations by identifying causes, effects, and their
      connections.  Once these connections are learned, the knowledge can be used to
      infer causes and effects where visual data might be partially hidden or
      ambiguous.  In this paper, we present a Bayesian grammar model for
      human-perceived causal relationships that is learnable from video.  Two
      experiments investigate high-level causal induction from low-level visual cues. 
      In the first experiment, we show that a computer can apply known heuristics used
      for causal induction by humans to learn perceptual causal relationships.  In the
      second experiment, we show that our learned model can represent humans'
      performance in reasoning about hidden effects in video, even when the computer
      initially misdetects those effects.</p>
