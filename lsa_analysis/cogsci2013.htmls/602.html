	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Joint attention has long been accepted as constituting a
      privileged circumstance in which word learning prospers. Consequently research
      has investigated the role that maternal responsiveness to infant attention plays
      in predicting language outcomes. However there has been a recent expansion in
      research implicating similar predictive effects from individual differences in
      infant behaviours. Emerging from the foundations of such work comes an
      interesting question: do the relative contributions of the mother and infant to
      joint attention episodes impact upon language learning? In an attempt to address
      this, two joint attention behaviours were assessed as predictors of vocabulary
      attainment (as measured by OCDI Production Scores). These predictors were:
      mothers encouraging attention to an object given their infant was already
      attending to an object (maternal follow-in); and infants looking to an object
      given their mothers encouragement of attention to an object (infant follow-in).
      In a sample of 14-month old children (N=36) we compared the predictive power of
      these maternal and infant follow-in variables on concurrent and later language
      performance. Results using Growth Curve Analysis provided evidence that while
      both maternal follow-in and infant follow-in variables contributed to production
      scores, infant follow-in was a  stronger predictor. Consequently it does appear
      to matter whose final contribution establishes joint attention episodes. Infants
      who more often follow-in into their mothers&#8217; encouragement of attention
      have larger, and faster growing vocabularies between 14 and 18-months of age.</p>
