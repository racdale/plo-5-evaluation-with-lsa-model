	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Why are some events more surprising than others? We propose that
      events that are more difficult to explain are those that are more surprising. The
      two experiments reported here test the impact of different event outcomes
      (Outcome-Type) and task demands (Task) on ratings of surprise for simple story
      scenarios. For the Outcome-Type variable, participants saw outcomes that were
      either known or less-known surprising outcomes for each scenario. For the Task
      variable, participants either answered comprehension questions or provided an
      explanation of the outcome. Outcome-Type reliably affected surprise judgments;
      known outcomes were rated as less surprising than less-known outcomes. Task also
      reliably affected surprise judgments; when people provided an explanation it
      lowered surprise judgments relative to simply answering comprehension questions.
      Both experiments thus provide evidence on this less-explored explanation aspect
      of surprise, specifically showing that ease of explanation is a key factor in
      determining the level of surprise experienced.</p>
