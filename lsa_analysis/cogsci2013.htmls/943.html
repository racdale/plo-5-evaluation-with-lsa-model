	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Affective stimuli encountered in everyday life - such as emotional
      words, scenes or facial expressions - can elicit well-investigated emotional
      experiences. For instance, two distinct event-related brain potentials (ERPs)
      have been reported in response to emotional facial expressions, an early
      posterior negativity (EPN), associated with enhanced attention and perception of
      affective stimuli, and a later centro-parietal positivity (LPP), assumed to
      reflect processing of the intrinsic relevance of emotional stimuli. Other rich
      sources of emotions that have yet received little attention in EEG research are
      internal mental events such as thoughts, memories and imagination. 

      Here we investigated mental imagery of emotional facial expressions and its time
      course using ERPs. We presented participants with neutral faces and asked them to
      imagine the faces with an emotional or neutral expression. Early ERP modulations
      during imagery resemble the effects frequently reported for emotional facial
      expressions, suggesting shared early processes underlying emotion perception and
      imagination.</p>
