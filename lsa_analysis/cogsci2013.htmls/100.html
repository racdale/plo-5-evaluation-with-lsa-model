	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent research has sought to examine how learners are able to
      track the co-occurrence of words and objects across moments in time, a behavior
      commonly termed cross-situational statistical learning. The current experiment
      was designed to examine if learners can simultaneously determine word-referent
      pairings while engaging in other cognitive processes that support language
      learning, such as distinguishing phonologically overlapping words. Participants
      were presented with a cross-situational statistical learning task with pairs of
      words in four categories: non-minimal pairs, near minimal pairs, vowel minimal
      pairs, and consonant minimal pairs. The results revealed that participants were
      able to simultaneously learn word-referent pairings while distinguishing all four
      categories of word pairings. However, learners experienced the most difficulty
      learning vowel minimal pairs. This work demonstrates that learners are able to
      simultaneously engage in multiple cognitive processes that support language
      learning. </p>
