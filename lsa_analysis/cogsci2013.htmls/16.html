	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Dynamical Field Theory (DFT) offers a framework for thinking about
      representation-in-the-moment in neural systems and changes in thinking over
      learning and development. Dynamic Neural Fields are formalizations of how neural
      populations represent the continuous dimensions that characterize perceptual
      features, movements, and cognitive decisions. DFT has been used across a variety
      of contexts including studies of working memory, word learning, executive
      function, and autonomous robotics. One obstacle for researchers wishing to use
      DFT has been that the mathematical and technical skills required to make these
      concepts operational are not part of the standard repertoire of cognitive
      scientists. The goal of this tutorial is to provide the training and tools to
      overcome this obstacle. We will provide a systematic introduction to the central
      concepts of DFT and their grounding in both Dynamical Systems concepts and
      neurophysiology. We will provide all needed background and give participants
      hands-on experience using interactive simulators in MATLAB. </p>
