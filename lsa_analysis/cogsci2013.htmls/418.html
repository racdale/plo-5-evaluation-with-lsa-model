	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study explores the effects of non-linguistic
      experiences on biases for linguistic judgments, specifically consonant deletion
      patterns. When two adjacent consonants come into contact as a result of
      morphological concatenation, many languages will delete the first consonant
      (e.g., /bepdok/ becomes /bedok/). Speakers of these languages (as well as English
      speakers) prefer deletion of the first consonant to the second consonant because
      the first consonant is perceptually weaker, making it more prone to
      misrepresentations and modifications. Following exposure to a non-linguistic
      analogue of consonant deletion in which the second consonant was deleted instead
      of the first, participants no longer preferred deletion of the first consonant in
      the metalinguistic judgment task. These results suggest that exposure to
      non-linguistic materials can interact with linguistic judgments. </p>
