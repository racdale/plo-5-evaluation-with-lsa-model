	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study explored the acceleration of student vocabulary growth
      and reading comprehension proficiency through a multi-part instructional strategy
      for engendering the inductive, semantic word-family-oriented acquisition of
      vocabulary from context, a difficult task for elementary students. Implemented on
      a schoolwide basis for an academic year in grades 3-4-5, the intervention was a
      four-part enhancement to a traditional basal reading program that constructed and
      used semantic word families for designated vocabulary words within stories.
      Results from HLM statistical modeling using student minority status and
      free/reduced lunch as covariates showed that experimental students in grades
      3-4-5 obtained significantly higher achievement on both ITBS Vocabulary and ITBS
      Reading Comprehension subtests. Implications for research and practice are
      discussed.</p>
