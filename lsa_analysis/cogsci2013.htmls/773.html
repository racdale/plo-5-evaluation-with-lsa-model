	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The paper explores the cooperation rate in one-shot
      Prisoner&#8217;s
      Dilemma games in three cases &#8211; when the game is played
      among friends, among foes, and among a mixture of friends
      and foes. The paper checks empirically the prediction that
      Simpson&#8217;s paradox like effects are to be expected in this
      situation (Chater, Vlaev, & Grinberg, 2008). The existence of
      a bias for cooperation when playing with friends and for
      defection when playing with foes, is expected to lead to a
      reinforcement of cooperation based on higher average payoffs
      in the mixed condition, i.e. when playing with friends and
      foes together. At the same time, the average payoff for
      cooperation remains lower for games with friends and foes
      taken separately (Simpson&#8217;s paradox). There results of the
      experiment support the existence of such effects and suggest
      that further exploration is worthwhile.</p>
