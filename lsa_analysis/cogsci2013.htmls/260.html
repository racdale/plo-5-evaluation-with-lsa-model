	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How are concepts represented in the human mind?  Vector space
      representations based on the instantaneous firing rates of neurons have been used
      with great success.  However, there is growing evidence, both empirical and
      computational, that relevant information is encoded in spatiotemporal patterns of
      spikes called polychronous neuronal groups (PNGs).  In this paper, we consider
      the philosophical implications of PNG representations with regard to their
      temporal extension, grounding, compositionality, and similarity.  We suggest that
      the temporally extended nature of PNGs implies that conceptual-level dynamics may
      only be coherent at coarse time scales.  We introduce the notion of PNG trigger
      sets as a way to ground the meaning of PNG representations, and we discuss
      potential approachs to compositionality.  Finally, we identify the open problem
      of how to define an appropriate similarity metric for PNG-based mental
      representations.</p>
