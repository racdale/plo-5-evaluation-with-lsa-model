	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>	Some of our generic knowledge is based upon what we consider to
      be normal instances of kinds of things.  We expect a normal dog to be
      four-legged; if it is not four-legged, we assume that something is wrong with
      this particular dog, or that it is incomplete as a kind of thing dog.  Prasada &
      Dillingham (2009) showed that one reason we expect certain properties to be
      present is because we understand them to be aspects of the kinds of things.  Our
      research offered an alternative hypothesis: these normative expectations are due
      to these distinct properties being beneficial in some way.  Four experiments
      investigated this using statements that prompted responses for normative
      expectations.  We found that while the beneficence of these properties does
      underwrite normative expectations to an extent, the predominant understanding was
      that these expectations were grounded in the aspectual quality of these
      properties.</p>
