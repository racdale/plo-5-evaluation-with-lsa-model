	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Scenes filled with moving objects are often hierarchically
      organized: the motion of a migrating goose is nested within the flight pattern of
      its flock, the motion of a car is nested within the traffic pattern of other cars
      on the road, the motion of body parts are nested in the motion of the body.
      Humans perceive hierarchical structure even in stimuli with two or three moving
      dots. An influential theory of hierarchical motion perception holds that the
      visual system performs a "vector analysis" of moving objects, decomposing them
      into common and relative motions. However, this theory does not specify how to
      resolve ambiguity when a scene admits more than one vector analysis. We describe
      a Bayesian theory of vector analysis and show that it can account for classic
      results from dot motion experiments. Our theory takes a step towards
      understanding how moving scenes are parsed into objects.</p>
