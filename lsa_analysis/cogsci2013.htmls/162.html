	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Both response latency and phonetic variation reflect competition
      among alternatives during the speech production process. A review of the
      literature finds an apparent contradiction in the latency results. In some tasks
      where latency is measured, similarity between targets and competitors results in
      slower reaction times. In other tasks, similar competitors appear to facilitate
      production times relative to non-similar competitors (though a lack of any
      competition at all results in the shortest response latencies). With respect to
      phonetic realization, experiments suggest that high levels of competition induced
      by sufficiently similar competitors result in hyperarticulation of target
      utterances. We present a Bayesian model of speech production that formalizes the
      selection and planning of spoken forms as noisy-channel communication among
      different levels of processing. The model resolves the apparent contradiction
      found in the latency results, and establishes a novel connection between those
      results and observed patterns of hyperarticulation.</p>
