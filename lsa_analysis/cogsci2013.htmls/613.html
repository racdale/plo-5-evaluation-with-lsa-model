	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study set out to investigate the influence of two
      metatextual features-presentation format and source expertise-on lay
      readers&#8217; explanation of conflicts in scientific information. Secondary
      school students read partly conflicting information about a medical topic, which
      was either presented in one single document or in four different documents, and
      which was purportedly authored by lay or expert sources. Results show that
      readers deemed deficits in source expertise (source explanations) more likely to
      account for conflicts in information written by lay authors than for conflicts
      reported by experts. In addition, conflicts presented by experts and conflicts in
      multiple documents were explained more strongly by referring to the nature of
      knowledge and knowledge production (epistemic explanations). Our findings
      demonstrate that readers are sensitive to situational variations when considering
      the most likely explanations for scientific conflicts. Implications for
      readers&#8217; adequate understanding and subjective resolution of scientific
      controversies are discussed.</p>
