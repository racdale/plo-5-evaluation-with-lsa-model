	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent research suggests that perception and action affect
      performance on cognitive tasks (e.g., Beilock & Goldin-Meadow, 2010; Landy &
      Goldstone, 2007). Here we investigated perceptual and motor influences on causal
      judgment from contingency using a causal discounting paradigm (e.g., Goedert &
      Spellman, 2005). Participants learned about two potential causes of a common
      outcome on a trial by trial basis. We varied the left/right location of a target
      cause and the left/right location of the &#8220;yes&#8221; response button for
      predicting the cause would produce the outcome. When there was a mismatch between
      the target location and the &#8220;yes&#8221; response, participants discounted.
      However, they did not discount when the two locations matched. Thus, we observed
      more accurate causal judgment with spatial overlap in the perception and action
      information. These results are generally consistent with an embodied cognition
      framework; however, their exact mechanism remains to be explored.</p>
