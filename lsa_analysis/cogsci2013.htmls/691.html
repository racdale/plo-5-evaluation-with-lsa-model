	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>With the first experiment of our study we have empirically tested
      the hypothesis that in adult and in adolescent subjects there is a consistency of
      the spatial representation of emotion terms. We explore the stability of the
      association between valence and verticality through modulation effect of the
      valence priming on spatial arrangement of emotion terms. In the second part of
      our study we focused on spatial representation of emotions by preschoolers when
      tested explicitly and implicitly with a task of spatial recall. It was found that
      the arrangement of emoticons on vertical and horizontal line by preschool
      children varied significantly as a function of the valence of emotions. The
      results from our third experiment suggest that the effect of the valence of
      nonverbal stimuli on the spatial recall was only evident when they were with a
      negative value and when placed at more central positions near to the horizontal
      line.</p>
