	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The processing of incoming sensory information relies on
      interacting mechanisms of sustained attention (the ability to focus attention and
      ignore irrelevant stimuli) and attentional capture (the ability of certain
      stimuli to reflexively attract one&#8217;s attention). Being able to precisely
      predict what can capture attention when it is engaged in a demanding task is
      important both for understanding the nature of attention as a cognitive system
      and also for practical applications. While evidence indicates that exogenous
      capture, a mechanism previously understood to be automatic, can be eliminated
      while concurrently performing a demanding task, we reframe this phenomena within
      the theoretical framework of the &#8216;attention set&#8217; (Most et al., 2005).
      Consequently, the specific prediction that cuing effects should reappear when
      dimensions of the cue overlap with those in the attention set (i.e., elements of
      the demanding task) was empirically tested and confirmed. Suggestions for further
      theoretical refinement and empirical testing are discussed.</p>
