	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We introduce a method for encoding co-occurrence of features
      in the HMAX model of visual recognition, and conduct a series
      of experiments to investigate the contribution of co-occurrence
      towards better recognition performance. We show that classification
      accuracy is increased by adding a higher-order layer
      to the HMAX processing hierarchy, whereby co-occurrence
      of features is encoded as a new dictionary of features. We
      show that concatenation of mean pooling, max pooling and
      co-occurrence information results in better classification results
      on three datasets (Caltech101, a subset of Caltech256,
      and TMSI Underwater Images). Overall, we show that incorporating
      co-occurrence statistics into a biologically-inspired
      model of visual recognition provides a boost in classification
      performance above that produced by incorporating occurrence
      statistics alone.</p>
