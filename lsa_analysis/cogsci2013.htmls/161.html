	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined whether a bilingual advantage can be found in older
      bilinguals that share the same cultural background with monolinguals. Sixteen
      Gaelic-English bilinguals over the age of 60 years were compared with three
      monolingual control groups in performance on the Simon task, as well as in
      general intelligence and socio-economic status. Some of the monolinguals were
      bidialectal allowing us to also test whether switching between dialects can incur
      similar cognitive benefits as bilingualism. Results showed no group differences
      in overall reaction times as well as in the Simon effect suggesting that
      individuals that share a cultural background may not exhibit differences in
      inhibitory control even if they routinely use another dialect or another
      language. This opens up the possibility that other factors associated with
      bilingualism, like immigrant status, may be responsible for the bilingual
      advantage found in some but not in other studies.</p>
