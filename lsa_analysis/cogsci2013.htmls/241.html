	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Conceptual metaphor congruency effects have been interpreted as
      evidence for the notion that the representation of abstract conceptual dimensions
      (e.g., power, evaluation) rests on more concrete dimensions (e.g., space,
      brightness). However, an alternative account based on the notion of polarity
      correspondence has recently received empirical support from studies about the
      mapping between affective evaluation and morality on vertical space. We tested
      the polarity correspondence account in the domain of number, which shows
      well-known congruency effects with lateral left-right space (the SNARC effect).
      Response polarity was manipulated by varying keyboard eccentricity in both parity
      (odd-even) and quantity (larger-smaller than 5) tasks. Response eccentricity did
      not modulate the SNARC effect. In a final experiment, the orthogonal Simon effect
      was modulated by the manipulation of response eccentricity. We conclude that
      polarity correspondence does not provide an adequate explanation of conceptual
      congruency effects in the domain of number. </p>
