	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Virtual humans (VHs) are digital anthropomorphic characters
      that exist within virtual worlds but are designed to perceive,
      understand and interact with real-world humans. Although
      typically conceived as practical tools to assist in a
      range of application (e.g., HCI, training and entertainment),
      the technology is gaining interest as a methodological tool
      for studying human cognition. VHs not only simulate the
      cognitive abilities of people, but also many of the embodied
      and social aspects of human behavior more traditionally
      studied in fields outside of cognitive science. By integrating
      multiple cognitive capabilities (e.g., language, gesture, emotion,
      and the control problems associated with navigating
      and interacting with a simulated virtual world) and requiring
      these processes to support real-time interactions with people,
      VHs create a unique and challenging environment within
      which to develop and validate cognitive theories. In this
      tutorial, we will review recent advances in VH technologies,
      demonstrate examples of use of VHs in cognitive science
      research and provide hands on training using our Virtual
      Human Toolkit (http://vhtoolkit.ict.usc.edu/).</p>
