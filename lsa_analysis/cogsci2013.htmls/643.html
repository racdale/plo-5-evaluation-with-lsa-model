	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>An experiment examined the effect of &#8216;pure&#8217;
      recognition &#8212; in the absence of concomitant evaluation &#8212; on
      inferences. In the first stage of the experiment, participants indicated whether
      they recognized a number of Italian and US cities. In the second stage, they
      decided which of two cities had the larger
      population. Crucially, names of the cities were not available in the second
      stage, but participants could find out whether they had recognized them (yes/no)
      in the first stage of the experiment (i.e., pure recognition). Additional
      predictive cues (e.g., presence/absence of a university) were also available.
      Participants used the recognition cue about 50% of the time, rarely examined it
      first, and used it differently as a function of whether recognition information
      was binary or continuous. Furthermore, participants used the recognition cue more
      often if they recognized more items, irrespective of its predictive validity.
      Implications for theoretical frameworks that view inference
      as driven by discrete heuristics or processes of evidence&#8211;accumulation are
      briefly discussed.</p>
