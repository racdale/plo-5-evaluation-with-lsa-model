	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Stoic behavior is defined as a behavior in which students tend not
      to seek help with a challenge. We investigated two types of stoic behavior:
      keeping-off behavior, in which students restrain themselves from requesting help,
      i.e., keep levels of help support at a minimum, and self-fading behavior, in
      which students voluntarily lower levels of support on their own volition. Three
      experiments were conducted. Overall, results showed that the participants
      actually exhibited stoic behavior when learning in an actual classroom setting.
      Self-fading was more difficult than the keeping-off behavior. The participants
      who maintained levels of support at a minimum through exhibiting active
      keeping-off behavior achieved greater learning gains, suggesting that stoic
      behavior resulted in positive impacts on learning. However, our experiment did
      not detect this effect for self-fading behavior. These experimental results were
      discussed with the assistance dilemma problem, generally occurring in instruction
      by intelligent tutoring systems.
