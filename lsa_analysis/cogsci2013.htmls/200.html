	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In sequential diagnostic reasoning, the goal is to infer the
      probability of a cause event from sequentially observed effects. Typically,
      studies investigating such tasks provide subjects with precise quantitative
      information regarding the strength of the relations between causes and effects.
      By contrast, we examined people&#8217;s performance when this information is
      communicated through qualitative, rather vague verbal terms (e.g., &#8220;X
      occasionally causes symptom A&#8221;). We conducted an experiment in which we
      compared subjects&#8217; judgments with a Bayesian model whose predictions were
      derived using numeric equivalents of various verbal terms from an unrelated study
      with different subjects. We found a remarkably close correspondence between
      subjects&#8217; diagnostic judgments based on verbal information and the
      model&#8217;s predictions, as well as compared to a matched control condition in
      which information was presented numerically. Additionally, we observed
      interindividual differences regarding the temporal weighting of evidence.</p>
