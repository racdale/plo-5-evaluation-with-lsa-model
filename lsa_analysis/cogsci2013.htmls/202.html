	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examined the relationship between human body movements
      and emotion based on Laban Movement Analysis (LMA). Ten participants participated
      in the experiment in which they stayed at a small resting room while hearing
      pleasant or unpleasant sounds. After the stay at the room, the participants rated
      their subjective emotional states. Participants' body movement were also recorded
      with four video cameras. The movement analysis based on LMA reveled  significant
      differences in movement features between experimental conditions. In addition,
      significant correlations between movement features and subjective mood ratings
      were observed. These results suggest a strong relationship between human body
      movements and emotion.
