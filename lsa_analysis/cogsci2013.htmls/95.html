	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Non-integer rational numbers, such as fractions and decimals, pose
      challenges for learners, both in conceptual understanding and in performing
      mathematical operations. Previous studies have focused on tasks involving access
      and comparison of integrated magnitude representations, showing that adults have
      less precise magnitude representations for fractions than decimals. Here we show
      the relative effectiveness of fractions over decimals in reasoning about
      relations between quantities. We constructed analogical reasoning problems that
      required mapping rational numbers (fractions or decimals) onto pictures depicting
      either part-whole or ratio relations between two quantities. We also varied the
      ontological nature of the depicted quantities, which could be discrete,
      continuous, or continuous but parsed into discrete components. Fractions were
      more effective than decimals for reasoning about discrete and continuous-parsed
      (i.e., discretized) quantities, whereas neither number type was particularly
      effective in reasoning about continuous quantities. Our findings show that, when
      numbers serve as models of quantitative relations, the ease of relational mapping
      depends on the analogical correspondence between the format of rational numbers
      and the quantity it models. </p>
