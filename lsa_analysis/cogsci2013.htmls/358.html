	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined lexical choice and variability in referring
      expressions during direction-giving to pedestrians. A stationary partner (the
      Giver) directed a mobile partner by telephone (the Follower) to walk about 1.8
      miles, to 18 destinations on a medium-sized campus. Followers returned to the lab
      and partners were tested individually on their spatial ability and memory for the
      destinations; then they participated in 6 rounds of a referential communication
      task to repeatedly match duplicate copies of pictures of the destinations.
      Results include significant rates of lexical entrainment and evidence for
      partner-specific conceptual pacts. Joint navigation efficiency was affected by
      direction-givers&#8217; (but not followers&#8217;) spatial ability. The Walking
      Around Corpus, an experimentally parameterized collection of spontaneous spoken
      dialogues produced by 36 pairs of people communicating by mobile telephone,
      provides a testbed for lexical entrainment &#8220;in the wild&#8221; as well as a
      resource for pedestrian navigation applications; it is available to the research
      community. </p>
