	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Prosociality emerges early in ontogeny, but the mechanisms driving
      its early-emergence are not well understood. We propose that the experience of
      choice is tied to the expression of children&#8217;s prosocial behavior. In
      Experiment 1, preschoolers shared with a puppet by either making a Costly Choice
      (giving a resource they could have kept for themselves), Non-Costly Choice
      (giving a resource that would otherwise be thrown away), or No Choice. Subsequent
      prosociality was measured by allowing children to share with a new puppet. While
      most children shared initially, children who were given costly choices shared
      more with the new puppet. Experiment 2 replicated this result using a different
      manipulation for Costly vs. Non-Costly choices. Experiment 3 found that
      preschoolers were more likely to infer that actions are intentional when they are
      costly. Results suggest a prosocial construal hypothesis: that children
      rationally infer their prosociality through making difficult, autonomous
      choices.</p>
