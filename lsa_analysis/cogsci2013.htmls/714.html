	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The current study examined whether language experience affects the
      processing of visual information. Spanish-English bilinguals and English
      monolinguals completed a visual search task in which no overt linguistic
      information was provided. Participants were shown an image of a target (e.g., a
      chair) and were asked to locate that object from an array of four images while
      their eye-movements were tracked. English Competitor trials contained an item
      whose English name overlapped phonologically with the English name of the target
      (e.g., chair-chain); Spanish Competitor trials contained an item whose Spanish
      name overlapped phonologically with the Spanish name of the target (e.g.,
      silla-silbato [chair-whistle]). Whereas all participants looked more often at
      English Competitor items than at items that did not overlap phonologically with
      the target, only the Spanish-English bilinguals looked more often at Spanish
      Competitor items. Results suggest that speakers with different language
      backgrounds vary in how they respond to non-linguistic, visual information.</p>
