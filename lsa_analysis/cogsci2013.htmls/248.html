	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Humans exhibit certain systematic context-dependent preference
      reversals when choosing among options that vary along multiple attribute
      dimensions. For instance, the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects each
      involves a change in relative preference between two options when a third option
      is introduced. Previously, such effects have been attributed to irrationality or
      sub-optimality in decision-making, or to specific architectural or dynamical
      constraints on cognition. We use a Bayesian model of multi-attribute choice to
      demonstrate that these effects naturally arise from three basic assumptions: (1)
      humans assess options relative to &#8220;fair market value&#8221; as inferred
      from prior experience and available options; (2) attributes are imperfectly
      substitutable, and scarce attributes are relatively more valuable; (3)
      uncertainty about market conditions and option values contributes to
      stochasticity in choice behavior. This work provides both a novel normative
      explanation for contextual modulation of choice behavior, and a means to predict
      choice as a function of past experiences and novel contexts.</p>
