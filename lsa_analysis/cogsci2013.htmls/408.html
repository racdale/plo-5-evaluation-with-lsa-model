	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Music is sometimes compared to language as a system of
      communication, however this comparison is usually at a generic formal, cultural
      or social level. This paper explores this analogy at the detailed level of
      interaction: to what extent can musical contributions act as conversational
      turns? We explore this question through an ethnographic study of music lessons.
      We describe a new transcription notation designed to capture the interactional
      details of musical contributions. Using this notation we show that although the
      ultimate objective of a lesson is development of musical performance, the
      detailed structure of the musical contributions depends on their interactional
      organisation. We show that musical contributions display interactional structure
      at the turn and sub-turn level and are closely integrated with other verbal and
      non-verbal cues as part of the unfolding conversation.</p>
