	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Semantic interference in word retrieval has been observed for both
      well-learned and ad hoc inter-item relations. We tested whether such semantic
      interference extends to the blocked cyclic naming of racially homogeneous vs.
      heterogeneous faces. No information except arbitrarily assigned names was
      provided for novel faces. Yet we observed interference in naming individuals in
      homogeneous groups. Moreover, consistent with other findings in the social
      domain, interference occurred for other-race but not for own-race faces. Because
      this interference effect does not require a rich knowledge base about
      individuals, it is consistent with the view that interference arises in
      adjustments to the strength of conceptual-lexical links rather than in knowledge
      structures themselves. Evidence of modulation by target race further suggests
      that interference effects may provide an effective tool for exploration of social
      categorization processes.</p>
