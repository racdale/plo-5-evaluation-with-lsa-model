	<h1>Does the listener keeps spatial information from the speaker&#8217;s cohesive gestures to comprehend subsequent sentences without gestures?</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examined whether listeners keep spatial story
      representation created by speaker&#8217;s cohesive gestures beyond the concurrent
      sentence. Participants were presented with three-sentence discourse with two
      protagonists, in the first and second sentences, the gestures consistently
      assigned the two protagonists in either right or left of the gesture space. The
      third sentence (without gestures) referred to one of the protagonists, and the
      participants responded with one of the two keys to indicate the relevant
      protagonist. The response keys were either spatially congruent or incongruent
      with the gesturally established locations for the two participants.  Experiments
      1 and 2 showed that the performance in the congruent condition was better than
      that in the incongruent condition. Thus, listeners make a spatial story
      representation based on the gestures, and the spatial representation persists
      beyond the concurrent sentence, and the information is still activated in a
      subsequent sentence without a gesture.  </p>
