	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Implicit transfer in sequential learning can occur with some
      spatio-temporal structures but not with others. Here, we investigated whether the
      consistent mirror-reversal of visuomotor sequences would lead to implicit
      transfer. A "set" comprised three sequential button presses and seven consecutive
      sets comprised a "hyperset." Participants learned hypersets by trial and error
      with their right hand. Then, they learned another hyperset, in which each set was
      vertically mirrored, horizontally mirrored, or randomly generated. Even when the
      participants did not notice the mirrored rule, the mirrored hypersets led to
      implicit transfer in terms of accuracy for both vertical and horizontal
      reversals. Furthermore, the vertical reserval also led to implicit transfer of
      performance speed. Taken together, the present results suggest that people can
      implicitly apply their learned representations to the mirrored visuomotor
      sequences. </p>
