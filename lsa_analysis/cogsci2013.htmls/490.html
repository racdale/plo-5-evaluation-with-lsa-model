	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Turkish Emphatic Reduplication (TER) occurs in adjectives
      and adverbs to accentuate their meanings. The current experimental
      study to investigate the selection of the linker type in
      TER indicated that responses from the participants correlate
      with some lexical statistics. The result relies on the statistics
      from a corpus with approximately 2 million Turkish words,
      which we use in lieu of lexical statistics. The frequency order
      of linker choice reported by the participants was exactly
      the opposite of the order of frequency of words in which the
      linker and the first consonant co-occur consecutively in the corpus.
      Such a direct link to lexicon was unexpected. We suggest
      that TER, an apparently phonological operation, depends on
      lexical access for selecting the appropriate linker whose cooccurrence
      with the initial consonant of the reduplicated word
      is infrequent. Our results relate morphology and lexicon in
      more ways than the blocking phenomena, and suggest that
      TER may be morpholexical.</p>
