	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There have been few studies on a cognitive model for algorithm
      understanding in a human-computer cooperative situation. In the present study, we
      conducted an experiment with participants to investigate the cognitive process of
      higher level abstraction (algorithm understanding) performed in a human-computer
      collaboration task. The most recently used (MRU) algorithm, known to be one of
      the simplest adaptive algorithms, and probabilistic MRU algorithm were used to
      test the human capability to understand an algorithm. The experimental results
      showed that inductive reasoning in which participants observed the history of
      computer action, and they updated a statistical model while restricting their
      focus on a certain history with deteministic bias and Markov bias played key role
      to correctly understand the MRU algorithm. The results also showed that deductive
      reasoning was used to understand algorithms when participants rely on prior
      knowledge, and that there was a case in which the algorithm, even known to be the
      simplest one, was never understood.</p>
