	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigate the effects of explaining anomalies (i.e.,
      observations that conflict with current beliefs) on belief
      revision, and in particular how explaining contributes to the
      rejection of incorrect hypotheses, the generation of
      alternative hypotheses, and the selection of a hypothesis
      that can account for anomalous observations. Participants
      learned how to rank students across courses using
      statistical concepts of deviation, and did so while either
      explaining sample rankings or writing their thoughts during
      study. We additionally varied whether or not candidate
      hypotheses about the basis for ranking were presented to
      participants prior to learning, and the number of sample
      rankings that violated intuitive misconceptions about
      ranking. Measures of learning and coded responses suggest
      that prompting people to explain can increase the rate at
      which they entertain both correct and incorrect hypotheses,
      but that explaining promotes the selection of a hypothesis
      that can account for anomalous observations.</p>
