	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Individuals make decisions under uncertainty every day based on
      incomplete information concerning the potential outcome of the choice or chance
      levels. The choices individuals make often deviate from the rational or
      mathematically objective solution. Accordingly, the dynamics of human
      decision-making are difficult to capture using conventional, linear mathematical
      models. Here, we present data from a two-choice task with variable risk between
      sure loss and risky loss to illustrate how a simple nonlinear dynamical system
      can be employed to capture the dynamics of human decision-making under
      uncertainty (i.e., multi-stability, bifurcations). We test the feasibility of
      this model quantitatively and demonstrate how the model can account for up to 86%
      of the observed choice behavior. The implications of using dynamical models for
      explaining the nonlinear complexities of human decision-making are discussed, as
      well as the degree to which nonlinear dynamical systems theory might offer an
      alternative framework for understanding human decision-making processes.</p>
