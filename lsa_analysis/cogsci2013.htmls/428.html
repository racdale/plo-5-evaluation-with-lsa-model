	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Under conditions where an object is inside another object and only
      a single face is visible, is there a bias to assume smooth continuation of the
      surface straight back into the object?  To examine the ability to estimate how
      features progress into a volume, participants viewed 16 pictures of everyday
      objects (rocks, food, wood) presented with only a single face visible (see Figure
      1).  Participants reported whether a highlighted region of a picture was present
      on the surface or extended into the object.  If they perceived the region as
      extending in, they positioned a rod to indicate the angle.  Surface responses
      were rare and instead participants&#8217; readily perceived 3D forms from 2D
      views.  Inspection of frequency histograms revealed a systematic bias to estimate
      the angle of extension in the 80-110&#176; range. This type of completion process
      suggests constraints on models of visual completion and has implications for STEM
      education, in particular, how students deal with ambiguity.</p>
