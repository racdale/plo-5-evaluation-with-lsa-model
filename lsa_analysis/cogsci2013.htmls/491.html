	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Growing bodies of research have investigated how digital games
      might be used as pedagogical tools and separately, how playing commercial games
      influences basic cognitive capacities or skills. The goal of the present research
      is to draw from these separate lines of research to ask how changes in basic
      cognitive capacities and formal learning gains may be related. The present study
      employed a game in which a ship moves through different environments using
      forces. The game teaches the basic relationships between objects and forces in
      Newton&#8217;s Laws of Motion. Students played one of two versions of the game.
      The predictive version encouraged planning and reflection, by allowing students
      unlimited time to place forces along a path. In the real-time version, forces
      immediately affected the player when selected. The results suggest that learning
      was equivalent across the versions, but changes in attentional capacities may
      differentially contribute to learning between versions.</p>
