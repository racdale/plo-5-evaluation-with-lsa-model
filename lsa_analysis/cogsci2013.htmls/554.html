	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We model the semantic recall sequences of 424 older adults aged
      between 69 to 103 years in the animal fluency task. Our results suggest that,
      under normal intellectual functioning,   memory search in old age (69&#8211;84
      years) is consistent with a dynamic process that switches between retrieval
      probes. With dementia and very old age (85&#8211;103 years), however, memory
      search seems to become more consistent with a static process that activates items
      in memory as a function of their frequency. The weight that probes have in
      determining the activation of items in memory seems to be an informative
      signature of the impact of healthy aging and dementia on memory search. Our
      results show that, with healthy aging and dementia, the activation of items in
      memory is increasingly more determined by the frequency of past experience with
      those items.</p>
