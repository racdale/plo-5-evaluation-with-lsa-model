	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Virtual models are a common instructional tool used in chemistry
      education to help students learn about the 3D structure of molecules. The present
      study examined effects of two interface design features on participant
      performance during a molecule orientation task. The features examined were 1)
      colocation of the visual and haptic workspace and 2) stereoscopic viewing. The
      results indicate that colocating the interface increased participant accuracy,
      while providing stereo did not. Neither factor affected response time. The
      effects of colocation were also reflected in subjective ratings of task demand
      measured by the NASA-TLX. Spatial ability was predictive of task performance but
      did not interact with interface effects. The findings are discussed in the
      context of spatial cognition and interface design for manipulating virtual
      objects.</p>
