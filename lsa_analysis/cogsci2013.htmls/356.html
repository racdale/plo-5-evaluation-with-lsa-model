	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>People tend to react more strongly to a dread risk, a rare event
      that kills many people at once, than to a continuous risk, a relatively frequent
      event that kills many people over a longer period of time, even when both cause
      the same number of fatalities. This different reaction to the dread risk is often
      considered a bias, but we show that it is an ecologically rational strategy. In a
      series of simulations, we found evidence that dread risks affect the population
      more severely over time than continuous risks causing the same number of
      fatalities. This holds particularly true when the risks affect children and young
      adults who would have produced future offspring if they had survived longer. </p>
