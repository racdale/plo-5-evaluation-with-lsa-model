	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The ability to choose problem solving strategies flexibly and
      adaptively is an important part of expertise. However, it is unclear how simple
      forms of problem solving practice affect flexibility. We investigate to what
      extent flexibility in strategy use is dependent on learners&#8217;
      characteristics as intelligence, working memory and prior knowledge and to what
      extent these individual differences influence how a student can exploit a
      learning situation. 

      In a microgenetic design with 24 trials of a mathematical problem solving task,
      we found that ninth-graders adaptivity of strategy choices increased linearly
      during practice without feedback and that feedback on strategy adaptivity
      facilitated the process. Adapting strategy choices to problem types led to
      shorter solution paths, higher solution rates, and higher speed. This is true
      independently of students&#8217; intelligence or working memory capacity.
      However, prior knowledge was a predictor of adaptivity, thus leading to a faster
      development of adaptivity.
