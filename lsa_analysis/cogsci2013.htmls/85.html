	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based method
      to analyze eye movement data. We conducted a simple face recognition task and
      recorded eye movements and performance of the participants. We used a variational
      Bayesian framework for Gaussian mixture models to estimate the distribution of
      fixation locations and modelled the fixation and transition data using HMMs. We
      showed that using HMMs, we can describe individuals&#8217; eye movement
      strategies with both fixation locations and transition probabilities. By
      clustering these HMMs, we found that the strategies can be categorized into two
      subgroups; one was more holistic and the other was more analytical. Furthermore,
      we found that correct and wrong recognitions were associated with distinctive eye
      movement strategies. The difference between these strategies lied in their
      transition probabilities.</p>
