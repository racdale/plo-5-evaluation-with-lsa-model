	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The purpose of this study is to extend a method of dynamic
      estimation of emphasizing points (DEEP) to estimate the emphasizing points of a
      group. A preliminary experiment investigated whether the interaction process
      would differ depending on the interaction style used, avoiding conflict or
      expressing opinions. The difference is caused by confidence in their opinions and
      their commitment to the decision making. We also proposed two extended methods
      corresponding to the different interaction processes. We then conducted an
      experiment to evaluate the methods using Embodied Conversational Agents. In
      conclusion, these proposed methods accurately estimate proposals and satisfy
      participants in the appropriate group. We could also observe that the
      participants carefully looked to their partner for their reaction in "avoiding
      conflict" group and that the participants concentrated on execution of the task
      in "expressing opinions" group.</p>
