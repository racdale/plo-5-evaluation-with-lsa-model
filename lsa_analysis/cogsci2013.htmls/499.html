	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cognitive ecology is a term that has been used in environments
      that are more tightly coupled and purpose-specific than environments of everyday
      life. In this paper I consider cases from a cognitive ethnography of older
      adults. These cases show the analytical use of understanding the diachronic and
      synchronic cognitive ecology in which cognitive processes of everyday life occur.
      Specifically I discuss how the social and physical ecology and changes in these
      can shape goals, the use of cognitive artifacts and the use of other cognitive
      resources in agent environments that are not as purpose created and not as
      tightly coupled as environments of previous studies in this field.</p>
