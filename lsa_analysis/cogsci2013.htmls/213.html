	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Auditory overshadowing occurs when the presence of an auditory
      stimulus interferes with visual processing. The current study tested whether this
      occurs due to a privileged attentional status of auditory input or due to the
      dynamic characteristics of auditory input. To address these questions,
      preschoolers completed one of four discrimination tasks.  In the sound, motion,
      and item baseline conditions, children discriminated these single information
      types by judging whether paired stimuli were the same or different. In the
      combined condition, children discriminated changing sounds, motions, or items in
      the face of competing input in the other two dimensions. Although
      children&#8217;s discrimination of all information types attenuated in the
      combined condition relative to baseline, motion and item discrimination
      attenuated more than auditory discrimination. This provides evidence that early
      in development auditory information receives privileged processing in the face of
      competing input. </p>
