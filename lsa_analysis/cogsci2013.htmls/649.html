	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Deaf individuals have difficulties in comprehending written text,
      as well as oral language. As a consequence, learning from text is compromised in
      deaf individuals. 
      We hypothesized that a transposition of the Italian Sign Language to its written
      counterpart could enhance signing deaf individuals&#8217; comprehension and
      learning from text. 
      We confirmed our prediction for comprehension and learning for technical texts in
      Experiment 1 and for narrative texts in Experiment 2; signing deaf
      individuals&#8217; text comprehension and learning therefore benefit from a
      written language whose structure reflects the structure of their visual-spatial
      sign language. 
      We speculate that, for signing deaf individuals, practice in reading written sign
      language texts might positively affect the ability to comprehend the written oral
      language texts.</p>
