	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Yeates, Jones, Wills, Aitken, McLaren and McLaren (2012) devised a
      serial reaction time (SRT) task that provided evidence for human learning without
      awareness. Adapting the SRT paradigm usually employed to investigate implicit
      learning, participants responded to two simple white circle fills on either side
      of a screen. Instead of these following a sequence that participants were unaware
      of (e.g. Willingham, Nissen & Bullemer, 1989) this task involved a separate
      stimulus, which was sometimes predictive of one of the circle fills. A square in
      the center of the screen would fill with one of eight colors before each circle
      fill: one of these colors predicted a right circle fill and the other a left on
      80% of trials on which those colors occurred. When pressing the key that followed
      the consistent response trained with these two colors, participants were both
      faster and more accurate than when responding to either the inconsistent response
      or control colors. Participants demonstrated a lack of contingency awareness,
      performing at chance in identifying the predictive colors and on a suitably
      sensitive prediction task. On reanalyzing this result, this paper shows that it
      was confounded with a sequential artifact produced by the experimental design
      itself. Pilot studies demonstrated weak learning of color contingencies when the
      artifact was removed, thus we sought to improve learning by both increasing the
      amount of training and placing the predictive color cue on the circle fills.
      Without the sequential artifact, we can produce the same result, although we
      concede the effect is less robust than we first indicated. Thus, we are able to
      reiterate our original conclusion: that this task can demonstrate learning of
      color contingencies in the absence of awareness and can be used to investigate
      implicit learning in humans.</p>
