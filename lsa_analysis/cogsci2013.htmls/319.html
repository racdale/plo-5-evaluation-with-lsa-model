	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Spatial skills have been associated with learning in STEM areas
      and some research has shown that playing video games could facilitate the
      development of spatial skills.  This study examines whether playing a game that
      uses a realistic physics engine and places spatial demands on the players could
      facilitate learning a subsequent physics lesson.  Fifty-eight participants viewed
      a brief lesson on Newton&#8217;s laws of motion after either playing the puzzle
      game Tetris or the first-person perspective puzzle game Portal, which
      incorporates aspects of physics such as momentum.  The groups did not differ on
      subsequent tests of learning outcomes involving physics, but the Portal group
      scored significantly higher on a perspective taking test (d = 0.57). This study
      shows that playing a commercial game that incorporates Newtonian physics does not
      prepare students to learn physics but does improve an important spatial cognition
      skill related to physics.</p>
