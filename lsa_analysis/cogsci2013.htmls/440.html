	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Prior research indicates a protracted developmental course in
      category-based reasoning. One possible explanation for the development of this
      ability is the gradual reorganization of semantic knowledge. To measure
      development of semantic knowledge we developed a new paradigm, the Semantic Space
      task, which uses distance in a two-dimensional space to infer semantic
      similarities between two objects. Using this paradigm we examined development of
      semantic knowledge in young children (preschoolers, kindergarteners, and
      first-grade children) and in adults. We also examined whether conceptual
      organization as measured by the Semantic Space task is predictive of
      children&#8217;s scores on a category-based reasoning task. The findings point to
      the possibility that development of semantic knowledge plays an important role in
      the development of category-based reasoning. </p>
