	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigate children's online predictive processing as it
      occurs naturally, in conversation. We showed 1--7 year-olds short videos of
      improvised conversation between puppets, controlling for available linguistic
      information through phonetic manipulation. Even one- and two-year-old children
      made accurate and spontaneous predictions about when a turn-switch would occur:
      they gazed at the upcoming speaker before they heard a response begin. This
      predictive skill relies on both lexical and prosodic information together, and is
      not tied to either type of information alone. We suggest that children integrate
      prosodic, lexical, and visual information to effectively predict upcoming
      linguistic material in conversation.</p>
