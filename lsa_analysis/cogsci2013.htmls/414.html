	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Almost two decades of research has demonstrated that labels
      facilitate infants&#8217; categorization of novel objects. Some interpret this as
      evidence of an early link between infants&#8217; linguistic and conceptual
      systems. Others suggest that these effects stem exclusively from lower-level
      processing mechanisms in cross-modal perception, and that words promote
      categorization only because they are more familiar to infants than non-linguistic
      acoustic stimuli and therefore easier to process. Here we address these
      discrepant interpretations using a novel approach. We expose infants to
      unfamiliar non-linguistic stimuli (sine-wave tone sequences), manipulating the
      exposure conditions. For 6-month-olds, if the novel acoustic stimuli were
      embedded within a communicative episode, they subsequently facilitated
      categorization (Experiment 1), but if they were presented in a non-communicative
      episode, they had no such effect (Experiment 2). We propose a developmental model
      that takes infants&#8217; burgeoning perceptual and conceptual capacities into
      account in identifying how communication and words are linked to concepts.</p>
