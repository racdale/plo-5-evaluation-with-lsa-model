	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It has been repeatedly debated which strategies people rely on in
      inference. These debates have been difficult to resolve, partially because
      hypotheses about the decision processes assumed by these strategies have
      typically been formulated qualitatively, making it hard to test precise
      quantitative predictions about response times and other behavioral data. One way
      to increase the precision of strategies is to implement them in cognitive
      architectures such as ACT-R. Often, however, a given strategy can be implemented
      in several ways, with each implementation yielding different behavioral
      predictions. We present and report a study with an experimental paradigm that can
      help to identify the correct implementations of classic compensatory and
      non-compensatory strategies such as the take-the-best and tallying heuristics,
      and the weighted-linear model.  </p>
