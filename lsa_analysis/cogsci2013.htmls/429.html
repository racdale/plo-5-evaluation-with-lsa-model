	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Drawing artists and non-drawers are like any adult both experts at
      face recognition. Yet, artists have a richer learning experience with faces: they
      were trained in rapid sketching of faces. Zhou, Cheng, Zhang and Wong (2011)
      found that drawing experts showed less holistic processing (HP) for face
      recognition than non-drawers. Using a computational model of face recognition
      that did not implement motor processing, we examined whether engagement of local
      attention and nature of the learning task could account for the reduced HP in
      drawers without the influence from motor experience. We showed that compared with
      the non-drawer model that had a global face input (i.e., Hsiao, Shieh & Cottrell,
      2008), a drawer model that incorporated both global face and local facial parts
      (eyes and mouth) in the input showed reduced HP, suggesting the modulation of
      local attention engagement. In contrast, the other drawer model that used only
      global face input but learned to perform an additional face part identification
      task did not show the reduced HP effect. In addition, both drawer models
      demonstrated stronger left side (right hemisphere) bias than the non-drawer
      model. Our data thus suggest that engagement of local attention is sufficient to
      account for the reduced HP in drawers, and that HP and left side bias effects can
      be differentially modulated by visual attention or task requirements.</p>
