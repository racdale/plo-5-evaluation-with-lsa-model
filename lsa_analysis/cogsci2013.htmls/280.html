	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Holistic processing and left-side bias are both behavioral markers
      of expert face recognition. In contrast, Chinese character recognition expertise
      involves left-side bias but reduced holistic processing (Hsiao & Cottrell, 2009).
      Here we examine whether the reduction in holistic processing associated with
      expert Chinese character recognition can be better explained by writing rather
      than reading experience. Compared with non-Chinese readers (novices), Chinese
      readers who had limited writing experience (Limited-writers) showed increased
      holistic processing, whereas Chinese readers who could also write characters
      fluently (Writers) showed reduced holistic processing. This result suggests that
      writing/sensorimotor experience can modulate holistic processing effects, and
      that the reduced holistic processing observed in expert Chinese readers may
      depend on writing rather than reading experience. By contrast, both Writers and
      Limited-writers showed a similar level of left-side bias in processing symmetric
      Chinese characters, left-side bias may therefore be a consistent expertise marker
      for object recognition uninfluenced by motor experience. </p>
