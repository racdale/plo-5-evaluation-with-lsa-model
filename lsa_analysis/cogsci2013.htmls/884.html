	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Story-telling performers often rely on their audience&#8217;s
      smiles, sounds of laughter, body movements, and other qualitative observations to
      gauge whether their performances are appreciated by the audience. The current
      study aims to capture the temporal patterns between a performer and his or her
      audience. A professional rakugo story-teller performed live in front of 20
      audience members aged 16 to 67 (M = 40.6, SD = 16.4) in a laboratory. Videotaped
      performances were categorized by a computer-aided coding system, and the
      audience&#8217;s reactions were quantified using the face-tracking and background
      subtraction computer program. Results demonstrated performer-audience
      correlations only in a particular frequency band. While the audience often smiled
      in response to incongruent lines and interpreted gestures, the performer
      sometimes delivered the points only after audience-initiated smiles and
      movements. This dynamic co-creation may offer suggestions for a variety of
      orators who speak regularly in front of audiences.</p>
