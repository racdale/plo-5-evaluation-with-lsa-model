	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Selective rehearsal of memories through conversation shapes
      subsequent recall for both speakers and listeners. Interactional memory acts have
      typically been studied in dyadic conversation or small groups; however, as
      Christakis and Fowler (2009) point out, humans don&#8217;t just belong to groups,
      we are more precisely enmeshed in social networks. This study extends Coman and
      Hirst&#8217;s (2012) work on propagation of socially-shared retrieval-induced
      forgetting (Cuc, Koppel, and Hirst, 2007) and social contagion (Roediger, Meade,
      & Bergman, 2001) across a series of conversations. We move from dyadic networks
      to a dynamically self-assembling social network of 46 undergraduates over a
      nine-week period. Using a framework derived from Kauffman&#8217;s (1994) models
      of adaptive fitness landscapes in evolution, we trace mnemonic convergence as it
      emerges from the interplay of &#8220;internal&#8221; cognitive factors and
      dynamics attributable to network connectivity. Contributions to the cognitive
      psychology of collective memory are discussed. </p>
