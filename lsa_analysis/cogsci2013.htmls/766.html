	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There is an ongoing debate about the relative contribution of
      conceptual and perceptual information to inductive generalization in early
      childhood. In the classic study bearing on this debate, pictures representing
      familiar animals were arranged such that category membership was supposed to be
      in conflict with perceptual similarity. However, later studies revealed that most
      of the stimuli in this study failed to impose this conflict. The present study
      revisited this issue. Extensive calibration was conducted to ensure that the two
      sources of information were in conflict. Despite near-ceiling accuracy in
      identifying the category membership of objects used in the study (e.g.,
      bird-bird-bat, dog-dog-cow, cat-cat-raccoon, etc.), 4-year-old children relied on
      their knowledge of category membership only 55% of the time when there was strong
      conflict between category membership and perceptual similarity. These findings
      will be discussed in relation to alternative accounts of knowledge acquisition
      and generalization early in development. </p>
