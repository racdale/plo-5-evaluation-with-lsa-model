	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Past research has uncovered evidence of social influences on a
      wide variety of behaviors.  Everything from our choice of clothing to smoking
      appears to be shaped by the people we know.  However, little is known about the
      mechanisms that underlie these influences. Here, we report a series of
      agent-based simulations demonstrating that information diffuses across social
      networks in much the same way that behavior diffuses.  These findings lead us to
      conclude that many previously observed social influences on behavior likely rely
      on a substrate of information transmission and representation.</p>
