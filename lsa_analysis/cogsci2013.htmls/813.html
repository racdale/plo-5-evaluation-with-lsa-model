	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There is considerable evidence that representations of word
      meaning are &#8220;embodied&#8221; and grounded in our perceptual and motor
      experiences (Barsalou, 2008; Glenberg, 2010). This research has mostly relied on
      priming and interference procedures, or measuring brain activity. The present
      study manipulated the perceptual appearance of words, specifically font size, to
      be congruent or incongruent with an object&#8217;s actual size (e.g., elephant
      presented in a large or small font, respectively). Participants were presented
      with the words prior to a recognition memory test and property judgment task, in
      the same session and after a 2-week delay, to see if the perceptual font
      information would be incorporated into the representations of words to
      potentially alter participants' memory and judgments. Font size generally did not
      significantly affect how participants represented and processed the words. These
      results therefore present a challenge for embodied accounts of semantics, but
      some potential explanations and issues will be discussed.</p>
