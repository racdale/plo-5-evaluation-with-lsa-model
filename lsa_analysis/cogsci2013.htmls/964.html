	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>An intrinsic motivation for social interaction has often been
      proposed and is thought to be unique to the human species. However, little is
      known about underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether
      experiencing engagement in social interaction recruits the reward system of the
      brain. A combined eye-tracking and fMRI paradigm was used in which participants
      interacted with a virtual agent in a series of gaze-based interactions in
      real-time. To create situations in which they experience the interaction as
      social or as non-social, they were made believe that during each block the
      agent&#8217;s gaze behavior could either be controlled by another human
      participant or a computer algorithm. The other participant was a confederate of
      the experimenter, which enabled experimental control of the agent's gaze
      reactions. After each block participants had to indicate whether they experienced
      the interaction as social or not. Results demonstrated that gaze-based
      interactions with a perceived human partner is associated with activity in the
      ventral striatum, a core component of reward-related neurocircuitry, while
      interactions with a computer-driven agent activate attention networks. In
      addition, the nature of the interaction with a human partner (naive vs.
      cooperative) differentially modulates striatal activity. </p>
