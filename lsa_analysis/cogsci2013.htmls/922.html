	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated interactions between mothers and their children
      and specifically measured differences in the mothers&#8217; verbal and nonverbal
      communication as a function of their children's age.

      Forty two-year-old children and forty five-year-old children and their mothers
      were video-recorded in two conversational settings. Measures were obtained for
      the mothers' speech complexity (mlu, use of verbs, complex sentences, and direct
      objects), their emotional prosody (pitch, pitch variability), and their pointing
      gestures.

      Mothers of 5-year-olds used more complex speech than mothers of 2-year-olds,
      whereas mothers of 2-year-olds showed more emotional prosody, and pointed more
      often than mothers of five-year-olds. This is interpreted as an adaptation to
      their children's conversational abilities. As younger children do not understand
      very complex utterances, but might rely on more nonverbal communication (such as
      pointing gestures and emotional prosody) than older children, their mothers might
      use a less verbally complex, but rather emotionally rich and non-verbally
      sophisticated interaction style. </p>
