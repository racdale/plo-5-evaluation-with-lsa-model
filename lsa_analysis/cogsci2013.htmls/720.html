	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The compromise effect and attraction effect are examples of
      irrational choice in multi-attribute decision making. Their underlying mechanisms
      are assumed to be differences in the trade-off structure of each choice set.
      Recent research on the construal level theory showed that a high construal level
      decreases the compromise effect, but increases the attraction effect. Further,
      studies on the dual process theory showed that the depletion of
      participants&#8217; cognitive resources increases the attraction effect, but
      eliminates the compromise effect. It is therefore important to examine
      compensatory (or uncompensatory) information search based on trade-off structure
      in these context effects. We examined the influence of the construal level of
      participants&#8217; choices and the depletion of
      participants&#8217; cognitive resources for the above two context effects.
      Furthermore, we analyzed eye movements as a measure of the information search
      process, to examine the relationship between the construal level theory and dual
      process theory.
