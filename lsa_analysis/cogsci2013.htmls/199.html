	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper we examine the idea of a "na&#239;ve physics" in
      humans solving physics problems. This invokes the idea that people have a theory
      of motion in their heads that is non- Newtonian, and hence leads to systematic
      errors on these problems. We are able to show that, by selecting our problems
      carefully, it is possible to obtain answers that are consistent with this
      na&#239;ve physics and inconsistent with it; suggesting that it is not used to
      solve these problems but sometimes offered as post-hoc justification for the
      answers given. We offer evidence that the answers given owe more to past
      experience than any theory, and that a theory that postulates extrapolation on
      the basis of associative memory can give a good account of our results.</p>
