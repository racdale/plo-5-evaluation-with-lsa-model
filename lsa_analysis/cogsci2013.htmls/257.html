	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present a model of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a classical
      neuropsychological test frequently used to assess deficits in executive
      functioning. The model is grounded in a cognitive architecture based on the
      Supervisory System theory of Norman and Shallice (1986) and evaluated against
      data from control subjects and several groups of neurological patients as
      reported by Stuss et al. (2000). The model is able to account for control
      performance across a range of dependent measures. When damaged in theoretically
      motivated ways it is also able to capture the behaviour of the different patient
      groups. Specifically, the model supports the association by Shallice et al.
      (2008) of the function of task-setting to left lateral prefrontal cortex, of the
      function of attentiveness to inferior medial prefrontal cortex, and of the
      function of monitoring to right lateral prefrontal cortex. The implication of
      these results for the supervisory system architecture and the localisation of
      function within prefrontal cortex are discussed.</p>
