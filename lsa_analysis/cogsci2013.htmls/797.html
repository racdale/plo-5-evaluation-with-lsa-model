	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present experiment was to test if high-arousing Chinese words
      can lead to increase repetition priming for emotional semantics. Participants
      were randomly assigned into two groups: one group was presented with positive
      words and another group with negative words. In Phase 1 of the experiment,
      participants rated high-arousing words and neutral words for concreteness. In
      Phase 2, they made decision to determine if it was novel word (half
      high-arousing, half neutral). In Phase 3, they were told to value the features of
      Chinese words which were not presented previously in a 5-point Likert scale and
      finished some parts of the Basic Personality Inventory (BPI) for assessing and
      controlling possible cognitive processing bias. The results showed a significant
      priming effect in two groups and the words presented in Phase 1 had shorter
      reaction times than the novel words. These findings revealed selective
      enhancement of Chinese word repetition priming by emotional arousal.</p>
