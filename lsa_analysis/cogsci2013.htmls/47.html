	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Classical theories of meaning in the field of linguistics and
      psycholinguistics assume that meaning arises from the combination of symbols for
      which a substring or other part-whole relation is defined. According to this
      perspective, symbols are abstract, amodal (i.e., neither perceptual, nor motoric)
      and only contingently related to entities in the external world.
      For a long time, a convincing case for classical models has been the absence of
      alternatives. However, more recently, several theories subsumed under the notions
      of &#8220;embodied&#8221; or &#8220;grounded&#8221; theories have challenged the
      fundamental assumptions of classical models (e.g., Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg,
      2010; Pecher & Zwaan, 2005). From the point of view of embodied theories,
      cognition is grounded in modal representations which simulate actual objects,
      properties and situations. Such a claim carries theoretical, empirical and
      methodological repercussions that also change the way linguistic processes are
      conceived of (Ferretti et al., 2013; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998). The goal of the
      symposium is to explore which repercussions these issues have on the nature of
      linguistic meaning and its neural and cognitive realization or
      representation.</p>
