	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Statistical word learning involves forming and aggregating
      associations between words and objects that co-occur across contexts (e.g.,
      Vouloumanos & Werker, 2009; Smith & Yu, 2008; Yu & Smith, 2007). However, the
      mechanisms that support such learning are currently under debate, including the
      extent to which learners carry forward multiple ambiguous associations (e.g.,
      Trueswell et al., 2013). The current study presented adults with a set of
      statistical word learning tasks designed to measure the statistical computations
      learners employ to build label-object mappings and to probe what information from
      past contexts is available to further process and integrate with new information.
      Results reveal that learners use the co-occurrence of label-object pairings to
      make inferences both about objects and labels currently present and those
      presented on previous trials. Further, the strength of learners&#8217; memory for
      past contexts moderated their inferences, suggesting a role for a rich
      information structure in cross-situational word learning.</p>
