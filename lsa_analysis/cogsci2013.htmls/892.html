	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In linguistic pragmatics and social anthropology, several
      influential researchers believe that politeness is essential for maintaining
      social order by way of disarming potential aggressiveness [Goffman 1967; Brown &
      Levinson 1987; Gumpers 1987]. In one of the most detailed of these theories,
      Brown and Levinson's, speakers pursue a single goal (e.g. getting the hearer to
      stop doing something) by using a mental model of the hearer to select a position
      on a one-dimensional spectrum of strategies that identifies the best balance
      between achieving the speaker's practical goal while avoiding offense to the
      hearer (as might occur from a purely brusque request). But are speakers actually
      limited to this one-dimensional spectrum of strategies? And given that people
      often pursue more than one goal at once, how might they do so in such a
      simplistic model of polite communication? I describe and evaluate a computational
      model that generates strategies for multiple simultaneous goals.</p>
