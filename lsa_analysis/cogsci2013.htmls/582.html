	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In a congestion game, individuals exhaust a common resource out of
      selfish behavior. In this scenario, drivers create traffic jams by choosing the
      shortest route according to their individual knowledge.  They can avoid them by
      communicating their belief states about the traffic situation in real-time
      through a peer-to-peer network, assuming unlimited bandwidth.  We study two
      potential, cognitively inspired models of human behavior: 1) categorization
      (quantized memorization and communication), which dampens communication and
      belief adoption, but leads to undesired oscillations and lower performance. 2)
      Instance-based blending with memory decay, which achieves good dynamics and
      near-optimal performance without the same bandwidth needs.  We argue that this
      supports our hypothesis of co-adaptation of cognitive function and communicating
      communities.</p>
