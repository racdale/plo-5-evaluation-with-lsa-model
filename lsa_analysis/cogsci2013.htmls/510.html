	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examined the effect of an explicit relational rule on
      sequence learning in a 3-choice serial reaction time task. Simple probabilistic
      contingencies between pairs of response cues were used in such a way that the
      sequence of cues moved predominantly in one direction (i.e. either clockwise or
      counterclockwise). Performance on cued and miscued responses was compared for a
      group given a hint about the abstract rule describing the relationship between
      the response cues, and a group given no information about this relationship.
      Experiment 1A demonstrated that XYZ and XYX subsequences showed performance
      differences when the location of the target on each trial was random. Experiment
      1B showed that giving participants the explicit hint affected XYZ subsequences
      more than XYX subsequences. Implications for sequence learning and, specifically,
      the interaction between rule and instance learning are discussed.</p>
