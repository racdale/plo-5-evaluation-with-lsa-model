	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The blocking effect in causal learning, once taken as a hallmark
      of associative learning, has recently been explained in terms of an explicit
      deductive reasoning process. Yet when the conditions necessary for deduction are
      removed, a small blocking effect is often still present. We examined the
      relationship between blocking and participants&#8217; performance on analytical
      thinking and probabilistic reasoning measures. Inferential processes predict
      blocking or an absence of blocking in this situation, depending on the
      observer&#8217;s consideration of conditional probabilities. Although Bayesian
      inference predicts blocking, most individuals are not inclined to use this form
      of probabilistic reasoning explicitly, an observation we confirmed using a
      logical problem with similar properties to the relationships present in the
      blocking effect. Furthermore, participants who showed the greatest capacity for
      analytical reflection were less likely to show a blocking effect, suggesting that
      blocking in causal learning is the product of an intuitive and unreflective
      thought process.</p>
