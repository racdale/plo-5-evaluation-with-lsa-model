	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Sleep-associated consolidation plays an important role in language
      learning (Dumay & Gaskell, 2007; Gomez et al., 2006). Here we test the hypothesis
      that greater levels of arbitrariness in the material to be learned are associated
      with an increased involvement of sleep (Eichenbaum et al., 1999). Two participant
      groups were trained to equivalent levels on novel words incorporating
      regularities mirroring a grammatical gender system. After training, participants
      had a 90-min break filled with either a polysomnographically recorded nap or an
      awake control task. Subsequently, the nap group outperformed the wake group in
      recognition and recall of the trained vocabulary items. Both groups showed
      evidence of generalization of the systematic aspects of the grammar to untrained
      items, but the nap group outperformed the awake on the grammar test on the
      trained items. The findings are discussed in the context of the Complementary
      Learning Systems approach (Kumaran & McClelland, 2012; McClelland etal.
      1995).</p>
