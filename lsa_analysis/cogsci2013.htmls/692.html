	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The relationship between word frequency (WF), measured on a
      continuous scale, and recognition memory was examined in a single item
      recognition task. The aim was to more clearly map the relationship between word
      frequency and memory performance. In marked contrastContrary to standard findings
      of a linear relationship when between WF and recognition,is treated as discrete,
      we observed a curvilinear pattern. Specifically, discriminability (d&#8217;) is
      higher at both the low and very high ends of the WF continuum. In addition, we
      observe shifts in bias (C) with a conservative bias for very high frequency (HF)
      words between WF and memory performance. Variations of a Bayesian signal
      detection model were then applied to the data in order to better understand the
      influences WF on measures of d&#8217; and C. The models examined contrast the
      current explanations of the WF effect in recognition where C does not influence
      performance with a model where C is free vary as a function of WF.of a linear
      relationship between WF and discriminability (d&#8217;) in recognition memory,
      with the curvilinear pattern for both d&#8217; and bias (C) with the curvilinear
      patterns observed in the current data set.  Implications for models of
      recognition memory are discussed.</p>
