	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Accounts of category-based inductive reasoning can be
      distinguished by the emphasis they place on associative retrieval processes
      versus structural knowledge representation. Using an open-ended category-based
      induction task with a secondary task manipulation, we explored whether the
      relative importance of these two processes in determining the reasoning output
      depends upon the availability of mental resources. Regressing indices of strength
      of association and measures of structured relation against reasoners&#8217;
      inferences showed that people&#8217;s inductions generated under cognitive load
      were more strongly predicted by associative strength between base and conclusion
      category. In contrast, inferences made under no load were best predicted by the
      measure of the existence of structural relations between base and conclusion
      category. This suggests that people make use of associative processes and recruit
      structured knowledge to make inductive inferences, and that the relative
      importance of these two forms of reasoning is determined by the availability of
      mental resources</p>
