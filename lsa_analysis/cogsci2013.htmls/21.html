	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The nature and extent of human rationality is an issue of ongoing
      debate. In the last two decades, this debate has been enlivened by the
      development and application of new theoretical frameworks. These include Bayesian
      notions of adjusting and using uncertain beliefs in an inductive manner as well
      as deductive probability-based logics as normative guidelines against which to
      weigh human judgments and decisions; the notion of ecological rationality based
      on lean and frugal heuristics well adapted to the structure of the environment;
      the notion of meta-cognitive myopia according to which people are accurate and
      sensitive in the processing the information in a given sample of observations,
      but are blind and naive to the history and validity of the sampled data; and game
      theory.</p>
