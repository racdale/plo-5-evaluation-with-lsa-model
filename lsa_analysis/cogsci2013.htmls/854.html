	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We report the results of whether syllables are frequency-modulated
      prelexical units in dyslexic children. Twenty-two French dyslexic children were
      compared to 44 chronological age-matched and reading-level-matched controls. A
      syllable compatibility procedure was combined with a visual syllable detection
      task (Exp. 1) and a visual masked priming paradigm in a lexical decision task
      (Exp. 2). Dyslexic children exhibited robust frequency-modulated prelexical
      syllable effects; high-frequency syllables elicited a syllable compatibility
      effect in both experiments, while low-frequency syllables favored either a CV
      target length or a CVC prime length effect. The frequency-modulated syllable
      effects were constant across both experiments following an expected developmental
      course, especially in a highly feasible task (Exp. 1). However, performance was
      drastically low in a highly demanding task (Exp. 2), suggesting impaired
      phonological procedures. We propose that dyslexic children do not have obvious
      impaired phonological representations but rather delayed or compensated
      phonological representations with impaired phonological procedures. </p>
