	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>While previous research has shown that working memory capacity
      (WMC) predicts sentence processing ability, the understanding of the relationship
      is limited as almost all studies have used the reading span task as their sole
      measure of WMC.  The current study examined how the effects of garden-path
      sentences and filler-gap dependencies (as indexed by the P600) related to four
      measures of working memory (reading span, operation span, anti-saccade and
      n-back). P600 effects for garden-path sentences correlated positively with
      operation span score while effects for object relatives correlated negatively
      with n-back accuracy.  These results indicate that, though both sentence types
      are associated with increased working memory demands, the resolution of temporary
      syntactic ambiguity and filler-gap dependencies recruit distinct working memory
      mechanisms.</p>
