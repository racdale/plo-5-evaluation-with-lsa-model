	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Influential work on human thinking suggests that our judgment is
      often biased because we minimize cognitive effort and intuitively substitute hard
      questions by easier ones. Recent work with adults who solved the bat-and-ball
      problem, one of the most publicized examples of the substitution bias, suggests
      that people realize they are doing this and notice their mistake. In the present
      paper we look at the development of this substitution bias sensitivity. A group
      of young adolescents solved standard and isomorphic control versions of the
      bat-and-ball problem in which reasoners experience no intuitive pull to
      substitute. Adults have been shown to be less confident in their substituted,
      erroneous bat-and-ball answer than in their answer on the control version that
      does not give rise to the substitution. However, the present study established
      that this critical confidence drop was less pronounced for young adolescents.
      This implies that in contrast with adults, young adolescents do not yet fully
      acknowledge the questionable nature of their biased answer and remain more
      oblivious to the substitution. That is, young adolescent reasoners seem to behave
      more like happy fools who blindly answer erroneous questions without realizing
      it. </p>
