	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent findings show that human inferences and decisions
      interfere in ways analogous to incompatible quantum
      observables, and conceptual judgments are inseparable in
      ways similar to entangled quantum states. This discovery has
      led a group of physicists and psychologists to form a new
      field called &#8220;quantum cognition,&#8221; which uses mathematical
      principles of quantum theory to explain human cognitive
      behavior. The power of this new theoretical approach is
      illustrated here by testing an a priori and precise prediction
      derived from quantum theory regarding question order effects
      commonly observed in survey research. The test of quantum
      theory was statistically satisfied across a set of 26 national
      surveys on presidential job approval and country satisfaction
      in past 10 years. These results suggest that quantum theory,
      initially invented to explain order effects on measurements in
      physics, provides a powerful prediction for measurement
      order effects in social and behavioral sciences too.</p>
