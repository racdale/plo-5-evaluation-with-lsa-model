	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Resolving disagreements by collective decision making requires
      knowledge about task and others&#8217; opinion quality. We tested dyads in a
      visual discrimination task to first show confidence of their individual decision
      and in case of disagreement announce their joint decision. Using a Bayesian
      approach, for each participant we compared the optimal decision rule (i.e.
      relative reliability of participant&#8217;s own opinion to that of his partner)
      to the empirically obtained (fitted) decision rule. The less sensitive observers
      (i.e. the ones who made poorer individual decisions) were significantly less
      successful in group decision making compared to their more sensitive partners.
      These less sensitive observers insisted on their individual decision as the group
      decision more often than recommended by the optimal decision rule. Our findings
      extent the previously found Dunning-Kruger effect to social decision making
      domain: the more incompetent are often less aware of their greater
      fallibility</p>
