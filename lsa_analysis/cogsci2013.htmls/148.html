	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many people have had the experience of knowing what song will play
      next on an album (even one heard only a few times). Conversely, many people fail
      to recognize an acquaintance encountered in an unfamiliar context. Associations
      can likely form simply because items appear nearby in time, and not only due to
      semantic similarity. Using surprise recognition testing, we examine the automatic
      storage of associations between successively encountered words on a list of
      incidentally studied words. Many modern memory models assume storage of such
      associations, but with little evidence as yet (e.g., Cox & Shiffrin, 2012; REM-II
      Mueller & Shiffrin, 2006). We find evidence for sequential associations, which
      are further improved by shared semantics or study context. We also find improved
      accuracy and response time for old words preceded by old words, and for new words
      preceded by new words&#8212;regardless of the previous response.</p>
