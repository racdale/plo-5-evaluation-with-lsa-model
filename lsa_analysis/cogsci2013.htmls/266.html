	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Two prominent approaches to describing how people make decisions
      between risky options are algebraic models and heuristics. The two approaches are
      based on fundamentally different algorithms and are thus usually treated as
      antithetical, suggesting that they may be incommensurable. Using cumulative
      prospect theory (CPT; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) as an illustrative case of an
      algebraic model, we demonstrate how algebraic models and heuristics can mutually
      inform each other. Specifically, we highlight that CPT describes decisions in
      terms of psychophysical characteristics, such as diminishing sensitivity to
      probabilities, and we show that this holds even when the underlying process is
      heuristic in nature. Our results suggest that algebraic models and heuristics
      might offer complementary rather than rival modeling frameworks and highlight the
      potential role of heuristic principles in information processing for prominent
      descriptive constructs in risky choice.</p>
