	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper looks into the effects of visual/linguistic stimuli in
      the activation of cognitive domains (e.g. image schemas for primary metaphors)
      which are necessary for the understanding of sentences content by individuals
      affected by Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD). AD studies point out to cognitive
      impairments at early stages of the disease which make comprehension tasks such as
      abstract inference, and metaphorical reasoning more costly to AD subjects in
      comparison to other groups of normal aging. We designed a 3x3 experiment in which
      subjects (AD and control group) were presented with primes of cognitive domains
      (words, pictures, and ideograms as control) followed by a choice task of
      metaphorical, literal, and abstract sentences in order to measure time spent to
      understand sentences in each condition, and frequency of each choice. Our
      hypothesis is that when the subject is primed with visual rather than linguistic
      input of a domain, s/he understands more readily and more accurately the
      metaphorical/inferential content of a linguistic expression, even though literal
      understanding frequency keeps higher.</p>
