	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research on human problem solving may be about to face a
      conceptual change from individual to collaborative problem solving. Many
      challenging problems in the real world are solved by groups or teams. This is
      increasingly recognized by the problem solving research community, which
      traditionally has emphasized cognitive processes in individual problem solving.
      In this paper we argue how approaches for investigating complex problem solving
      can be conceptually extended towards collaborative problems solving. We will
      present several current examples of how to measure collaborative processes in a
      standardized way. One example is the InBox HD, a computer-based in-basket
      simulation with collaborative elements. The second example is the scenario
      Product Planning, implemented in the ColPS HD framework, which involves
      chat-based human-to-agent communication.  We will elaborate on how these tools
      can be used to emulate realistic collaborative processes in the standardized
      setting of a psychological laboratory and indicate directions for future
      developments.</p>
