	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The critical step facing every decision maker is when to stop
      collecting evidence and proceed with the decision act. This is known as the
      stopping rule. Over the years, several unconnected explanations have been
      proposed that suggest nonoptimal approaches can account for some of the
      observable violations of the optimal stopping rule. The current research proposes
      a unifying explanation for these violations based on a new stopping rule
      selection (SRS) theory. The main innovation here is the assumption that a
      decision maker draws from a large set of different kinds of stopping rules and is
      not limited to using a single one. The SRS theory hypothesizes that there is a
      storage area for stopping rules&#8212;the so-called decision operative space
      (DOS)&#8212;and a retrieval mechanism that is used to select stopping rules from
      the DOS. The SRS theory has shown good fit to challenging data published in the
      relevant literature.</p>
