	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Word order varies not only across languages but also within a
      specific language. Turkish, for example, has a non-rigid word order. Therefore,
      it is a good test-bed to understand the processing complexity driven by the
      order. One way to observe the complexity is to investigate it via diagrammatic
      reasoning. In this study, 18 sentences with scrambled word orders and the
      corresponding diagrammatic representations were analyzed by 20 Turkish native
      speakers. There were deliberate errors in the representations and the
      participants were asked to report them. The participants&#8217; eye-movement data
      were also collected. Results indicate that scrambled word ordering also causes
      latencies in diagrammatic reasoning task. The eye-movement fixation orders showed
      that the participants favored VSO and VOS eye-fixation orders independent of
      sentential word orders. It is also concluded that finding the errors in verbal
      representations were more time consuming than finding the errors in object and
      subject representations.</p>
