	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Our research aims to study the Effect of Set in the process of
      perception of unconscious information.  In the experiments, we use serial
      (multiple) unconscious stimulation and the modified masked priming technique to
      give unconscious stimuli to our participants. In the experiments we demonstrate
      that, as a result of the  specially organized preliminary experimental series, it
      is possible to receive the steady priming-effect for the unconscious stimulus
      which initially didn&#8217;t render any noticeable influence on the effectiveness
      of the tasks solutions. We can conclude, that at unconscious level cognitive
      system analyzes series of unconscious influences. So, the nature of influence of
      each following unconscious stimulus on the current conscious cognitive activity,
      by the time of its occurrence, is already set on the basis of the analysis of the
      previous series of influences. It is possible to model these individual settings
      in the experimental environment.</p>
