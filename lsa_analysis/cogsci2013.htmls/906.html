	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The human ability to learn from sparse rewards has been modeled
      with the temporal difference learning mechanism, using an actor-critic
      architecture (Montague, Dayan, & Sejnowski, 1996). These models incorporate an
      "adaptive critic" which learns a "value function": a mapping from the learner's
      current situation to expected future reward. In complex environments, a "value
      function approximator" (VFA) must be implemented to allow generalization between
      similar situations. While some implementations of VFAs have been successful
      (Tesauro, 1992), this approach does not consistently converge to a solution
      (Boyan and Moore, 1995). With the goal of developing a general and reliable VFA
      mechanism, capturing human level learning performance, we have explored the use
      of spiking neural networks, including liquid state machines, as a technique for
      VFA learning in complex environments. We report on simulations demonstrating the
      benefits and pitfalls of using the temporal dynamics of neural spikes to encode
      the learner's state. </p>
