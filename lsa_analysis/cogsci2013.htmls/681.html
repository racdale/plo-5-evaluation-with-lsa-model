	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Employing the dynamical systems framework, we study the
      effects of intrinsic motivation on the dynamics of the learning
      processes. The intrinsic motivation here is the one&#8217;s desire
      to learn not because it may cause some benefits in future, but
      due to the inherent joy obtained by the very process of learning.
      We study a simple example of a single agent adapting
      to unknown environment; the agent is biased by the desire to
      select the actions she has little information about. We show
      that intrinsic motivation may cause the instability of the learning
      process that is stable in the case of rational agent. Therefore,
      we suggest that the effects of human intrinsic motivation
      in particular and the irrationality in general may be of exceptional
      importance in complex sociopsychological systems and
      deserve much attention in the formal models of such systems.</p>
