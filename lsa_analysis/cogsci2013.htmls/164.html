	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Computational accounts have traditionally focused on mapping
      between structured representations as fundamental to analogical processing.
      However, a recent connectionist model has been used to argue that structured
      representations may not be necessary to solve verbal analogies. Green and
      colleagues (2010) have shown that brain areas associated with analogical mapping
      become more engaged as semantic distance increases between verbal analogy source
      and targets. Herein, we had participants verify verbal analogies characterized
      for semantic distance while we monitored their brain waves using EEG. Our results
      suggest that the semantic distance between the source and target of a verbal
      analogy does influence early semantic processing as reflected in the N400
      Event-Related Potential. However, successfully differentiating valid and invalid
      verbal analogies engages areas of prefrontal cortex widely associated with
      inhibitory processing and the integration of abstract relations in working
      memory. Thus, it appears that traditional semantic priming alone is likely
      insufficient to explain the full extent of analogical processing.</p>
