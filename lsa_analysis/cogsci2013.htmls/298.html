	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Making a choice between alternatives can influence our subsequent
      evaluation of the selected option (e.g. Sharot, Velasquez & Dolan, 2010). Thus,
      in resolving psychological uncertainty, the act of making a judgment itself
      appears to have a constructive role in subsequent related decisions. This study
      focuses on emotional ambivalence and the development of affective evaluations
      over two stages, such that (just) making an intermediate evaluation in the first
      stage is shown to influence the overall affective evaluation in the second stage.
      Models based on classical probability theory, which assume that an intermediate
      evaluation simply reads off an existing internal state, cannot accommodate this
      result in a natural way.  An explanation is offered with a quantum probability
      model, which, under specific circumstances, requires the measurement of an
      internal state to have a constructive role. The predictions of the quantum
      probability model were supported by the empirical results.</p>
