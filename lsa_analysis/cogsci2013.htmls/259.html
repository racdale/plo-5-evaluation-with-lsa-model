	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>One question in word production is how the presence of a
      semantically related word affects the naming process. It has been suggested that
      semantic effects in picture-word interference tasks are a net result of both
      inhibitory and facilitatory processes that take place at different processing
      levels. Finkbeiner and Caramazza (2006) argued that masking distractor words
      removes the inhibitory component, leaving only lexical facilitation. We
      investigated this claim by comparing different types of semantic relationship
      &#8211; categorical relatedness, associative relatedness, and a combination of
      both &#8211; in picture-word interference with masked and visible distractors. We
      observed inhibitory effects in all conditions. In the visible condition, semantic
      category coordinates exerted the strongest inhibition, while in the masked
      condition, associatively related distractors interfered most. These findings are
      not easily reconciled with previous findings on polarity shifts of semantic
      effects with masked distractors. We discuss how all present findings could be
      explained within the same framework. </p>
