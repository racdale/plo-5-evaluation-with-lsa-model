	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Acquiring new skills is not a set-in-stone process and students
      often take various paths to the goal; the acquisition of the required skill. To
      assess this learning process, previous studies used hidden Markov models to
      separate the cognitive stages of a problem solving task similar to solving
      algebraic equations (e.g. Anderson et al., 2012; Anderson, 2012). Because of the
      slow nature of fMRI recordings, this method can only discriminate between
      relatively long states in the process. This study extends the approach by
      including eye movements as a predictor of state, in an attempt to increase
      temporal resolution of the method. The results show that eye movements can be
      used to trace the characteristics of the problem the subject is working on.
      Because tracking eye movements is a non-invasive measure that can be used outside
      experimental settings, this can benefit the discovery of problems students
      encounter while solving algebraic problems.</p>
