	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper reports experimental results on the Index of Cognitive
      Activity (ICA), a recent micro-level measure in pupillometry which relates
      processing load to the frequency of rapid small variations in pupil diameter. We
      collected pupil size data during three language processing tasks (German subject
      vs. object relative clauses, a grammatical gender violation, and semantic
      anomalies). We report the first results on the Index of Cognitive Activity for
      language processing and show that the ICA is responsive to all of our
      manipulations. We also compare the ICA results to overall pupil dilations and
      self-paced reading as a measure of processing difficulty. Overall, the use of the
      ICA as opposed to traditional pupillometry seems promising, as our data provide
      initial evidence that the ICA may be a faster and more fine-grained measure of
      cognitive load than overall pupil dilation.
