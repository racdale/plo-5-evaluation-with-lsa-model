	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Across a range of psychometric tests, reaction times slow as adult
      age increases. These changes have been widely taken to show that
      cognitive-processing capacities decline across the lifespan. Contrary to this, we
      suggest that slower responses are not a sign of processing deficits, but instead
      reflect a growing search problem, which escalates as learning increases the
      amount of information in memory. A series of computational simulations show how
      age-related slowing emerges naturally in learning models, as a result of the
      statistical properties of human experience and the increased
      information-processing load that a lifetime of learning inevitably brings. Once
      the cost of processing this extra information is controlled for, findings taken
      to indicate declines in cognitive capacity support little more than the
      unsurprising idea that choosing between or recalling items becomes more difficult
      as their numbers increase. We review the implications of this for scientific and
      cultural understanding of aging.</p>
