	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Construction tasks involve numerous demanding sub-tasks such as
      creating a mental model of the goal object and integrating the object parts into
      this model. For this purpose object parts need to be assigned a function within
      the overall structure. In this paper we examine the linguistic represen- tation
      of this process. Participants were given 16 object parts to assemble without a
      manual, and were asked to think aloud while doing so. Depending on condition they
      were not given any specific information, or told that the goal object was a
      dollhouse, or shown a picture of the dollhouse. In a second study, participants
      were asked to instruct a partner to assemble the dollhouse. Results of our
      linguistic analysis of think-aloud data and instructions reveal three strategies
      of assigning function to objects, one of which occurred exclu- sively in
      instructions. With less specific information about the goal object, functions
      were more often assigned explicitly. In these cases function tended to relate to
      the overall structure (e.g. &#8216;house&#8217;) rather than to structural parts
      (e.g. &#8216;wall&#8217;).</p>
