	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examined the processing correlates of aspectual
      coercion among native and non-native speakers of English.
      For native English speakers, results suggested that the
      processing delay associated with aspectual coercion is
      minimal. Aspectual coercion was perhaps cognitively easy
      to perform. By contrast, non-native speakers of English from
      unlike first language (L1) backgrounds differed in their
      reading performance. The differences varied systematically
      as a function of aspectual contrasts in L1 after controlling
      for second language (L2) English proficiency. Korean
      participants showed trends of aspectual coercion despite the
      absence of significant effects; German participants exhibited
      indifference across experimental conditions; Chinese
      participants showed aspectual coercion effects opposite to
      the predictions specified by the English grammar. A
      coupling of these data with evidence from the semelfactive
      progressive (e.g. coughing) in English suggests that the socalled
      online aspectual coercion effects may arise from a
      prototype organization of aspectual categories that is prone
      to L1 influence.</p>
