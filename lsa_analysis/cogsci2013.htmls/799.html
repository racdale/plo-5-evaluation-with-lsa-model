	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous work has shown that a continuum of truth is reflected in
      real-time motor movement behavior (McKinstry, Dale & Spivey, 2008). In a
      mouse-tracking paradigm, participants responded yes or no to statements of
      varying truth-values such as "A thousand is more than a million" or "English is a
      language" as well as more ambiguous statements such as "Murder is sometimes
      justifiable". In the present study, we replicated these results along an 11-point
      continuum of truth-values, finding that the end-points of averaged mouse
      trajectories vary as a function of truth-value. In addition to this, negated
      versions of each stimulus were tested and revealed that truth-values for negated
      sentences follow more complex trajectories and do not preserve the original
      truth-value of the statement. The evidence found presents a problem for theories
      of negation that require a revision from the affirmative meaning. Alternative
      mechanisms for how truth is affected by negation are proposed. </p>
