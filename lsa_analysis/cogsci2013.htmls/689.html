	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is a limited information store
      that supports many higher-order cognitive processes. Here we examined how two
      challenges to VSTM, sleep deprivation (SD) and maintenance duration, interact to
      affect the number and precision of stored items. Participants were studied twice,
      once after a normal night of sleep and once following a night of total SD. For
      each trial, participants remembered the location and color of three squares over
      a variable delay (1 or 10 seconds), reporting the color of the cued item using a
      color wheel. The probability of reporting the target item, the precision of
      report, and the probability of reporting a distractor item were determined using
      mixture modeling. SD reduced the number of integrated representations that could
      be reported, an effect compounded by delay. In contrast, SD had no effect on VSTM
      precision. These results suggest all-or-none memory failures, not gradual
      degradation, during SD.</p>
