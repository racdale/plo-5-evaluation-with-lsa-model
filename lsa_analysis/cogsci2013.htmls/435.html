	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>People demonstrate a consistent tendency to favor holistic or
      global
      processing over processing of local details in many perceptual
      domains; this tendency is called global-local precedence.  Formal
      musical training is associated with qualitative changes in auditory
      processing, but the number of years required remains unclear,
      particularly for any perceptual differences between untrained and
      minimally trained participants.  In this study, participants with zero
      to over ten years' music training identified the direction of pitch changes 
      in three-sound sequences.  Only participants with three or more years'
      training demonstrated a significant global-local precedence.
      Individuals without musical training consistently identified the local
      direction of pitch-change sequence elements better than global pitch
      changes across each sequence.  Although musical training was
      associated both with greater task accuracy and with global-local
      precedence, improved accuracy did not explain the musically trained
      participants' preferential processing of global auditory
      characteristics.</p>
