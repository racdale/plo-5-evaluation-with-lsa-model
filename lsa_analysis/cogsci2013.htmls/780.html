	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Social interaction involves the simultaneous uptake of a range of
      linguistic and nonlinguistic information. In a seminal study, Rubin (1992) has
      shown that a lecture spoken by a native speaker of Standard American English
      presented along with a photograph of an ethnically Asian instructor affected
      comprehension score and accentedness ratings more negatively as compared to the
      same lecture and speaker presented with a Caucasian instructor. Here we asked
      whether such effects could be observed in a multicultural environment, with a lot
      of interactions with different ethnicities and non-native speakers. Furthermore,
      we investigated how the effect could be modulated by the quality of the speech
      input (clear compared to noisy speech). The results showed that ethnicity affects
      accentedness ratings only under adverse listening conditions and that
      comprehension scores do not depend on ethnicity of the speaker. Thus, the effect
      of nonlinguistic information on linguistic processing is constrained in
      multicultural settings.</p>
