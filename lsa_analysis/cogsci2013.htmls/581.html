	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Difficulty with social interactions is a hallmark characteristic
      of autism spectrum disorders. While many studies have investigated the neural
      mechanisms underlying atypical social cognition, the methods used have rarely
      involved social interaction, relying instead on offline reasoning about a
      character. In the current study, we examined whether and which brain systems are
      sensitive to online social interactions in individuals with autism. We compared
      functional MRI data collected from 15 neurotypical (NT) and 15 autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) participants during live real-time interactions (Live) and during
      a video replay of the same interaction (Recorded-Same) and a novel interaction
      (Recorded-Novel). Whole brain analyses demonstrated a significantly greater
      response to Live than Recorded conditions, in NT vs ASD, within left posterior
      superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and regions of the cerebellum bilaterally. Region
      of interest analyses revealed that right posterior temporal regions were
      differentially recruited during online social interactions in the ASD and NT
      groups. Also, regions commonly associated with personal salience (i.e., dorsal
      anterior cingulate and bilateral insula) were sensitive to online social
      interactions in NT, but to novelty in the ASD group. These data suggest reduced
      and atypical neural sensitivity to online social interactions in individuals with
      autism. </p>
