	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In a word association task, the probability of producing a certain
      response to a cue is considered to be a direct measure of associative strength
      between words in the mental lexicon. The common single word association procedure
      is limited, since the number of words connected to a cue might be underestimated
      when a single response is asked. The continued association task overcomes this
      limitation by asking a person to generate multiple associative responses. To test
      whether continued strengths allow a better approximation of our lexicon, an
      experiment was conducted in which participants judged the associative strength
      between words. 

      Our results show that in contrast to other semantic tasks, continued strength
      predicts weak to moderate judgments only. Two explanations based on the sampling
      of information and differential semantic activation of later responses in
      continued association are proposed. Theoretical implications for semantic
      activation and methodological implications for derivation of strength are
      discussed.</p>
