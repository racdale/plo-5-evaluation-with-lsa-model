	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Birch & Bloom (2007, Psych. Sc. 18, 382-386) suggest that adults'
      reasoning about others&#8217; mental states is influenced by their privileged
      knowledge about reality. When asked where a person described in the story would
      search for a missing object, subjects tend to judge with higher probability that
      the person would search in a particular box, when they know that the object is
      indeed in that box. However, the results of their experiment could be an effect
      of unintended priming in the materials, i.e., the increased attention towards the
      box might be also caused by reading about it in the task instructions. In a new
      version of the experiment, we controlled for this factor by priming different
      locations in the instructions. The results show that it is unlikely that priming
      is the source of the Birch and Bloom's observations: only knowledge about reality
      changes the strategies in reasoning about others&#8217; actions.</p>
