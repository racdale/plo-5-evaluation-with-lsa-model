	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The input to a cognitively plausible model of language acquisition
      must have the same information components and statistical properties as the
      child-directed speech. There are collections of child-directed utterances (e.g.,
      CHILDES), but a realistic representation of their visual and semantic context is
      not available. We propose three quantitative measures for analyzing the
      statistical properties of a manually annotated sample of child-adult interaction
      videos, and compare these against the scene representations automatically
      generated from the same child-directed utterances, showing that these two
      datasets are significantly different. To address this problem, we propose an
      interaction-based framework for generating utterances and scenes based on the
      co-occurrence frequencies collected from the annotated videos, and show that the
      resulting interaction-based dataset is comparable to naturalistic data. We use an
      existing model of cross-situational word learning as a case study for comparing
      different datasets, and show that only interaction-based data preserve the
      learning task complexity.</p>
