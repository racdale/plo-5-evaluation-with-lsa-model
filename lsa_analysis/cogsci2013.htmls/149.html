	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research has found that people can use word-object
      co-occurrences from ambiguous situations to learn word meanings (e.g., Yu &
      Smith, 2007). However, most studies of cross-situational learning present an
      equal number of words and objects, which may simplify the problem by, for
      example, encouraging learners to use assumptions such as each word going with one
      object. This paper presents several conditions in which the number of words and
      objects do not match: either additional objects appear at random, or objects
      appear sometimes without their intended words. These manipulations do generally
      hurt learning in comparison to balanced conditions, but people still learn a
      significant proportion of word-object pairings. The results are explored in terms
      of statistics of the training trials&#8212;including contextual diversity and
      context familiarity&#8212;and with the uncertainty- and familiarity-biased
      associative model. Parametric differences between conditions hint at hidden
      cognitive constructs.</p>
