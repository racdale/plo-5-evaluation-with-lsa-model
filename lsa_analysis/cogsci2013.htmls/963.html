	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The purpose of this study is to examine whether Japanese junior
      high school pupils really dislike mathematics. In addition to questionnaires to
      inquire explicitly of the likings of school subjects, we administered the FUMIE
      Tests (Mori et al., 2008) to 512 junior high school pupils to assess the implicit
      evaluative association to the school subjects. We found a considerable proportion
      of pupils answered negatively to the target school subjects in the questionnaire
      while their implicit association scores showed somewhat positive valences. The
      discrepancies were larger for &#8220;mathematics&#8221; than
      &#8220;science&#8221;. One hundred of 512 pupils answered negatively to
      mathematics while their implicit measures were positive. In contrast, only five
      of 102 showed the same discrepancy for science. These results imply that there
      may exist a tendency to pretend to be a math-dislike in pupils. We discussed this
      tendency that may eventually lead them to real math-dislikes.</p>
