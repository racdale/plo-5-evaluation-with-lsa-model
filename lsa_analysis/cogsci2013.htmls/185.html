	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Time concepts are named differently across the world's languages.
      In English, the names for days of the week and months of the year are
      opaque&#8212;to people learning and using English, there's no obvious reason why
      Friday or September have the names they do. But in other languages, like Chinese,
      time concepts have numerically transparent names&#8212;the days of the week and
      months of the year are named using sequential numbers. We investigated whether
      having opaque versus mathematically transparent time concepts affects how people
      reason about time. Results show that Chinese speakers are more likely to
      spontaneously employ arithmetic when doing temporal calculations, which in turn
      improves the speed and accuracy of some time calculations. English speakers
      appear to use other strategies, such as sequential recitation.</p>
