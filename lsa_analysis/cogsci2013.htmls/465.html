	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In cognitive science there is a paradox: Researchers studying
      decision making have repeatedly shown that people employ simple and often less
      than optimal strategies when integrating information from multiple sources.
      However, researchers working in fields such as categorization, memory, and
      perception have had great success using optimal models to account for information
      integration. Is this conflict due to the use of different materials and
      procedures? We test the hypothesis that stimuli requiring more controlled
      information integration lead to suboptimal performance, while stimuli that lend
      themselves to more automatic processing produce more optimal integration. We test
      for one canonical example of sub-optimal information integration, the dilution
      effect, using stimuli more commonly found in perception experiments. Dilution was
      indeed reliable across several conditions. The largest effects occurred in
      stimuli manipulated so as to discourage automatic processing. We use the
      Multi-component Information Accumulation model to explain how stimulus
      presentation influenced cognitive processing.</p>
