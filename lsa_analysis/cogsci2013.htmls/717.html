	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Pure alexia (PA) is characterised by abnormally strong length
      effects in word reading times. It is often thought to result from damage to
      visual processing. This visual damage was also found to cause impaired object
      recognition performance (e.g., Roberts et al., 2012), suggesting a general visual
      deficit. Many computational models of reading have successfully simulated
      different forms of acquired dyslexia (e.g., Coltheart et al., 2001; Plaut et al.,
      1996). However, an adequate computational account of pure alexia has yet to be
      produced. We developed a large-scale and complete connectionist model with
      asymmetric hemisphere processing to support both word and object recognition.
      When damage was applied to the left visual processing layer in the model, the
      model produced abnormal length effects and impaired object recognition similar to
      those seen in PA patients. The results provide evidence to support the view of a
      common visual processing in visual word recognition.</p>
