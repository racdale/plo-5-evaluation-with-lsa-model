	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It has been suggested that individuals use simple decision
      strategies for comparative judgments. According to the recognition heuristic (RH;
      Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 1999), people infer that a recognized object scores
      higher on a criterion, if one of two objects is recognized, but not the other.
      Hilbig, Erdfelder, and Pohl (2010) have argued that previous research lacked
      process-pure estimates of RH use and rigorous model testing and proposed the
      r-model, a multinomial processing tree (MPT) model. Addressing these
      methodological issues, we present a first MPT analysis of differences in RH use
      between younger and older adults. Model-based analyses indicated that in both age
      groups the RH was used adaptively more often in the environment with higher
      recognition cue validity (cities), as opposed to a domain with lower cue validity
      (diseases). The validity of further knowledge or recognition as decision cues did
      not differ between age groups. Moreover, we examined the model estimates on the
      individual level by applying a Bayesian hierarchical approach and compared these
      estimates with behavioral indices and measures derived from signal-detection
      theory. The resulting comparisons with standard RH-adherence rates indicated high
      correlations. Further implications are discussed.</p>
