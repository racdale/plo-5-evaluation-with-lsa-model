	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Exploratory learning before instruction can benefit understanding,
      but can also be challenging. Individual differences in response to challenge,
      such as achievement motivation, may therefore moderate the benefits of
      exploratory learning. Higher mastery orientation generally leads to increased
      effort in response to challenge, whereas higher performance orientation leads to
      withdrawal. Children (2nd-4th grade; N=159) were given mathematical equivalence
      problems to solve as either an exploratory learning activity (before instruction)
      or as practice (after instruction). Higher mastery orientation was associated
      with improved learning from exploration. In contrast, performance orientation did
      not lead to learning improvements&#8212;and sometimes even hurt learning. Higher
      mastery orientation was also associated with more sophisticated problem-solving
      strategies during exploration. Although exploratory activities have the potential
      to advance strategy selection and subsequent learning, achievement motivation may
      boost or hinder these benefits.   </p>
