	<h1>Embodied Mental Imagery</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A new theory of visuo-spatial mental imagery and a computational
      model of the theory are presented. 
      The theory assumes (visual) perception to be an active and guided process
      comprising of several low-level perceptual actions. Mental concepts are grounded
      in sets of such actions. Imagery comprises the "offline" employment of these
      actions providing concrete instances of the mental concepts through bodily
      feedback such as proprioception.
      The theory is compared to the contemporary theories and evaluated against a set
      of well established phenomena, i.e., mental scanning, mental reinterpretation,
      eye movements, unilateral neglect.
      It is argued that the theory provides explanations that go beyond those offered
      by the contemporary theories. 
      The results provide support for the explanatory power of an embodied approach to
      cognition in which sensorimotor interaction constitutes conceptual knowledge in
      that it provides grounding and concrete manifestation of the semantics of mental
      concepts in the domain of visuo-spatial mental imagery.</p>
