	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Graphical overviews have been studied as a method to improve
      hypertext learning and digital search. Although previous studies have found
      learning benefits to graphical overviews of single hypertext, it is unclear if
      these benefits extend to online learning across multiple (independent) documents.
      Previous research also has found that graphical overviews facilitate domain focus
      during online search, but it has not been established whether these benefits are
      derived from the spatial organization of the graphic or its textual content. This
      research examined the impact of using graphical overviews organized either
      spatially (i.e., network view) or textually (i.e., outline view) during
      self-regulated online learning. Assessments focused on deep understanding of
      science concepts and the relationships between them. Results indicated that the
      outline view promoted deeper understanding of science concepts and fewer errors
      about the relationships between them. Implications are discussed for the design
      and implementation of instructional materials to support self-regulated
      learning.</p>
