	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The N400 ERP component is widely used in research on language and
      semantics, but the specific underlying mechanisms are currently unclear. We
      explored the mechanisms underlying the N400 by examining how a connectionist
      semantic network&#8217;s performance measures covary with N400 amplitudes. We
      simulated six N400 effects obtained in empirical research. Network error was
      consistently in the same direction as N400 amplitudes, namely smaller for high
      frequency words, words with few semantic features, semantically related targets
      and repeated words. Furthermore, the repetition-induced decrease was stronger for
      low frequency words and words with many features. In contrast, semantic
      activation corresponded less well with the N400, and instead seemed related to
      lexical decision performance. Our results suggest an interesting relation between
      N400 amplitudes and semantic network error. In psychological terms, network error
      has been conceptualized as implicit prediction error. Thus, N400 amplitudes may
      reflect implicit prediction error in semantic memory (McClelland, 1994).</p>
