	<h1>Effects of orthography on second language phonology: The production of geminate consonants in speakers of English as a Second Language</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We tested the hypothesis that the orthographic representations
      (&#8216;spellings&#8217;) of second language (L2) words affect experienced L2
      speakers&#8217; pronunciation. 
      In Italian, double consonant letters represent geminate (long) consonants. We
      predicted that Italian speakers of English would pronounce English words with
      longer consonants if spelled with double letter, e.g. a longer [t] in kitty than
      city. Three groups of Italian speakers of English performed different word
      production tasks with different stimuli: acoustic, acoustic and orthographic, or
      orthographic. The target voiceless stop consonants were presented inside 9 word
      pairs, spelled with one or two letters. Acoustic and auditory analyses revealed
      that the target consonants were longer in words spelled with double than with
      singleton letters, regardless of task. 
      We argue that L2 speakers decode L2 orthographic representations using L1
      orthography-phonology correspondences. This affects their pronunciation, even
      leading to the establishment of a phonological contrast (singleton-geminate) that
      is unattested in the target language.</p>
