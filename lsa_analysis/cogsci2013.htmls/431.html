	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Resolution of the meaning of a semantically ambiguous word
      requires knowledge about the space of possible meanings of that word, and the
      selection of a meaning in the light of available evidence and given situational
      constraints. As such, ambiguity resolution bears many similarities to decision
      making scenarios more generally. We report on an experiment exploring this
      analogy by applying some standard manipulations from the decision making
      literature to a semantic disambiguation task. We explore two particular
      proposals: (1) that depth of semantic processing can be cast as strategy
      selection reflecting a risk-sensitive effort-accuracy tradeoff, and (2) that
      thresholds for inference about meaning in context are situationally flexible and
      learnable via feedback. One robust property of decision making is people&#8217;s
      ability to use feedback in order to adjust responses to maximize payoffs.
      Participants completed a semantic entailment judgment task in which they received
      trial-by-trial feedback, and payoff matrices and decision thresholds were
      manipulated across conditions. We find an effect of risk, with participants
      employing different comprehension strategies depending on relative gains and
      losses. We also find that participants were in fact sensitive to varying decision
      thresholds and accurately adjusted their behavior to match the constraints on
      what qualified as a true conclusion in different conditions. We take these
      findings as preliminary evidence that ambiguity resolution in language can be
      modeled, at least in part, as involving more general decision processes.</p>
