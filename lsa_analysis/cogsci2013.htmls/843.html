	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Before an election, voters are inundated with messages about
      candidates running for office. Our work examines the influence of metaphor in
      messages about political races. Of special interest is the role of manner of
      motion (e.g., slow, fast) and aspect (e.g., perfective, imperfective) in messages
      that include motion metaphors (e.g., &#8220;Candidate A raced/was racing ahead of
      Candidate B&#8221; and &#8220;Candidate A inched/was inching ahead of Candidate
      B&#8221;). We discuss results from our experiments with English and Russian
      speakers. In line with our predictions, manner of motion and aspect were found to
      interact in interesting ways, and to systematically influence opinions about who
      is likely to win an election. These novel results have valuable theoretical and
      practical implications for political communication and how people conceptualize
      political elections, and expand prior work on framing effects in political talk,
      especially motion metaphors and grammatical aspect (Fausey & Matlock, 2010;
      Matlock, 2012).</p>
