	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The analogy of space to human cognition has a long-standing
      tradition. Our study aims to elaborate on the validity of this analogy for search
      in memory. Using the search of associative memory framework (SAM) we show that
      people are able to dynamically recruit independent memory representations in the
      recall of country names. By instructing participants to use specific recall cues
      we also show that despite a strong effect on the retrieval sequence, total recall
      from memory remains unaffected. Whereas these findings strongly support a higher
      dimensionality to memory than often assumed, the simultaneous finding of severe
      retrieval time costs for non-default representations suggests that the use of
      particular retrieval structures may be adaptive. In sum, our results support
      local-to-global memory search strategies similar to foraging strategies in space,
      but further suggest that memory is not constrained to one local representation,
      but may indeed support many. </p>
