	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A novel human memory system architecture is proposed. The memory
      system is an integration of three distributed memory systems associated with
      respective autonomous organic systems, including the perceptual system that takes
      care of sensory input from the environment, the conscious system that performs
      deliberate decision making, and the unconscious system that carries out action
      selections in the environment. This memory system architecture is consistent with
      the wide range of recent findings in the field of neurosciences. The memory
      system architecture works as a memory component in the comprehensive real brain
      model, MHP/RT, published in the Cognitive Science conferences, and the BICA
      conferences. MHP/RT is capable of simulating human daily behavior considering
      real time constraints that should define strong mutual dependencies among the
      three systems. With this memory system architecture, MHP/RT becomes a real brain
      model to be contrasted with virtual and partial models, such as ACT-R.</p>
