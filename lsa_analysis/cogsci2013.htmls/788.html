	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>As a species, humans stand out for superior cognitive capacities,
      including improved working memory and abstract representation. However, these
      abilities evolved, develop, and are generally utilized within a context of
      cultural transmission and ongoing interaction with the environment. This raises
      two complementary questions: To what extent does culture scaffold effective
      employment of our cognitive capacities, and to what extent is learning possible
      in culture&#8217;s absence? Experiment 1 demonstrates that participants given a
      verbal &#8220;hint&#8221; can use working memory to optimize rewards in a simple
      sequential learning task, whereas even after hundreds of trials of experience,
      those not given a hint can only learn the task suboptimally. Experiment 2
      demonstrates similar results for hierarchical rule abstraction. In these
      experiments, hints are akin to cultural scaffolding, and their influence on
      learning helps identify how our ability to spontaneously leverage our unique
      cognitive capacities is limited in isolation from culture.</p>
