	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Across different domains the magnitude of a stimulus is positively
      correlated with its perceived duration: bigger, brighter or louder stimuli are
      usually perceived to last longer than smaller, dimmer or softer ones. According
      to A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM), temporal and nontemporal magnitudes are linked
      in the human mind by virtue of sharing a common metric. This claim has been
      challenged by studies in the domains of brightness and loudness suggesting that
      it is not the difference in magnitude between stimuli, but rather their degree of
      change from background that modulates duration judgments. But do the same
      relationships hold between perceived duration and all prothetic dimensions? We
      tested the influence of stimulus magnitude and relative change on temporal
      judgment in the domain of space. We found that, unlike brightness and loudness,
      spatial length can influence duration judgments independently of the degree of
      change from a common background, and that this effect is context dependent. Thus,
      an approach based exclusively on the degree of change between stimulus and
      background is not sufficient to account for the effect of magnitude on temporal
      judgments. Our results suggest that space has a privileged link with temporal
      representations compared to other prothetic domains, challenging the hypothesis
      that space-time relationships are the product of a domain-general magnitude
      system. </p>
