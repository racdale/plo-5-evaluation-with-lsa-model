	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent studies show controversial results on the trainability of
      working memory (WM) capacity being a limiting factor of human cognition. In order
      to contribute to this open question we investigated if participants improve in
      trained tasks and whether gains generalize to untrained WM tasks, mathematical
      problem solving and intelligence tests.

      83 adults trained over a three week period (7.5 hours total) in one of the
      following conditions: A high, a medium or a low WM load group. The present
      findings show that task specific characteristics could be learned but that there
      was no transfer between trained and untrained tasks which had no common elements.
      Positive transfer occurred between two tasks focusing on inhibitory processes. It
      might be possible to enhance this specific component of WM but not WM capacity as
      such. A possible enhancement in a learning test is of high educational interest
      and worthwhile to be investigated further.</p>
