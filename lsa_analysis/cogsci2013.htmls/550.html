	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Sound symbolism or the nonarbitrary link between language sound
      and meaning are commonly found across many languages of the world. A well-known
      example is the association between rounded vs. angular shapes and labels (i.e.,
      K&#246;hler, 1929/1947).  Previous research has shown that sound symbolic words
      play facilitative role for preschool children&#8217;s novel verb learning,
      helping children identify what aspects of motion events should be mapped to
      verbs. In this research, we explore whether sound symbolism may facilitate
      language learning in human infants who have just begun to learn word meanings.
      Sound symbolism may be a useful cue particularly at the earliest stages of word
      learning, because this cue seems to be available without needing prior word
      learning experience. Using a habituation paradigm and a Bayesian model-based
      analysis, we demonstrated that 14-month-old infants could detect K&#246;hler-type
      (1947) shape-sound symbolism, and could use this sensitivity in their effort to
      establish the word-referent association.</p>
