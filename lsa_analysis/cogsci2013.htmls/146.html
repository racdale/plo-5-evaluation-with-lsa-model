	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In line with usage-based accounts, recent psycholinguistic studies
      have confirmed that frequency of occurrence impacts processing latencies for
      multiword strings (e.g., Arnon & Snider, 2010). However, these studies have not
      been concerned with the meaning of the multiword chunks in question, which is
      central to accounts of formulaic language rooted in cognitive linguistics (e.g.,
      Wray, 2002). Here, we address this issue by comparing processing latencies for
      three types of multiword chunks: idiomatic expressions, meaningful compositional
      phrases, and less meaningful fragments. All three chunk types were matched for
      whole- and sub-string frequency. Our results show that frequency facilitates
      processing for all three chunk types, but to a lesser extent than their
      &#8220;meaningfulness&#8221; (as assessed in a separate norming study),
      indicating that the meanings of multiword expressions may have implications for
      models of language processing which extend beyond those of frequency of
      occurrence. </p>
