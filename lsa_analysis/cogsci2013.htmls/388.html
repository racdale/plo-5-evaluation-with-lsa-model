	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study investigated the role probabilistic and deductive
      relations play in the reasoning process. It was predicted that when taking an
      analytic stance to a problem, it would take longer to evaluate inferences when
      asked how probable it is that the conclusion is true, than when asked whether the
      conclusion follows or not from the premises. Contrary to this prediction, people
      responded faster when the response format was continuous. However, there was no
      effect of argument type with continuous response format, suggesting people did
      not assess entailment relations in this condition. Options to address the issue
      further are discussed.
      Keywords: deductive/inductive reasoning; dual process theories; task effects;
      response times.</p>
