	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The temporal co-occurrence of a novel word and a visual referent
      undoubtedly facilitates establishing the meaning of a word. It is less
      understood, however, how precisely learners can keep track of the frequencies of
      these co-occurrences across situations. Observational learning may rely on one or
      few highly informative exposures (propose-but-verify) or it may be driven by the
      collection of evidence in a more gradual and parallel manner (multiple-hypotheses
      tracking). We evaluated both hypotheses within two experiments and found that
      learners were able to keep track of more than one hypothesis for a novel word.
      However, this memory was strongly dependent on each learner&#8217;s individual
      learning path (i.e., which meanings they had considered before) and influ-enced
      by the order of presentation of potential referents. We argue for an account of a
      multiple-proposal memory rather than a multiple co-occurrence memory.</p>
