	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Subjects' eye movements were recorded while they read sentences
      for comprehension. Sentences were presented with capitalized nouns&#8212;in
      agreement with German spelling rules&#8212;or completely in lowercase. Overall
      reading speed was not influenced by the manipulation of capitalization, but
      fixation durations were affected by the interplay between capitalization and the
      word classes of the fixated and the succeeding word. As expected, fixations were
      shorter for capitalized than lowercase nouns, but unexpectedly they were longer
      when the upcoming word was also a noun. This modulation was reduced when all
      words were printed completely in lowercase. We interpret the results as evidence
      for distributed processing across several words.</p>
