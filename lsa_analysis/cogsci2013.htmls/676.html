	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Quantitative analyses and the analyses of a questionnaire were
      conducted to examine the relations between participants&#8217; communicative
      activities and their interactional attitudes in conversations both in their
      native and second languages. The two categories of conversations revealed
      different gaze patterns that reflected the differences in difficulties they had
      with communication and grounding patterns. The participants were less conscious
      of their own gazes in conversation in their second language than those in their
      native language probably because of the difficulties and mental pressure they
      felt.</p>
