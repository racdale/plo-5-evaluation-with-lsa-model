	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Visual information contributes fundamentally to the process of
      object categorization. The present study investigated whether the degree of
      activation of visual information in this process is dependent on the situational
      relevance of this information. We used the Proactive Interference (PI) paradigm.
      In two experiments, we manipulated the information by which objects could be
      retrieved from memory: by both semantic and shape information or by shape
      information only. The pattern of PI-release showed that if objects could be
      stored and retrieved both by semantic and shape information, then shape
      information was overruled by semantic information. If, however, semantic
      information could not be (satisfactorily) used to store and retrieve objects,
      then objects were stored in memory in terms of their shape.</p>
