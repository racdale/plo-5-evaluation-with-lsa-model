	<h1>Pedagogy and Technology: Balancing student-centric learning with teacher-centric teaching</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Technology can be used to create student-centric learning in
      diverse ways, including the use of social media platform(s) and interactive
      simulations to teach inductive thinking, and games to facilitate self-directed
      learning. But, teacher-centric teaching is important as student-centric learning
      is; both aspects contribute to the student learning process, although the former
      has hardly been considered explicitly. Specifically, while technology develops
      apace, that teachers might continue to prefer traditional teaching modes and
      styles is an issue that should not be taken lightly, because teaching
      performances can be compromised if these modes and styles were compelled to
      evolve prematurely. I will particularly discuss the apprehensions that teachers
      might have as a technology-based teaching culture rapidly emerges, and how the
      dissonance between (non-)preferred modes of teaching and learning in this context
      might be resolved, in order to promote a technology-enhanced education system
      that ultimately benefits both teachers and students in a practical way.</p>
