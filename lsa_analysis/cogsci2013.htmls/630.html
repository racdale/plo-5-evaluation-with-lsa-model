	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated whether emotions are activated during
      comprehension of emotion words. In the first part of the study, an experiment was
      conducted in which participants read sentence pairs each describing an emotional
      state and then engaged in a judgment task. Sentences were paired to either match
      or mismatch in emotion (happy, sad, or angry). We predicted that the sentences
      that mismatch in emotion produced longer reaction times than those where the
      emotion was the same, and that shifts between negative emotions had less of an
      impact. In the second part of the study, we calculated the frequency of
      first-order co-occurrences of nouns and adjectives related to happy, sad, and
      angry emotional states. This analysis demonstrated emotion words are more often
      accompanied by similar emotion words.  Match and mismatch of emotion explained
      RTs as did statistical linguistic frequencies of the words. The combination of
      these two studies contributes to a growing body of research that supports the
      importance of both symbolic and perceptual processing of emotion.</p>
