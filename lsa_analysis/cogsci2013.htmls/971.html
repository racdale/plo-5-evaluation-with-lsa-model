	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Ever seen two people walking down the street in the exact same
      pace? This kind of interpersonal synchrony has been observed in both humans, as
      well as in animals (e.g., large groups of fireflies flash at the same time,
      schools of fish and flocks of birds synchronize their movement). For animals it
      appears to be beneficial (for survival) to synchronize their behavior, but what
      are the benefits for humans to do so? There are indications that interpersonal
      synchrony supports social bonding. Previous studies have shown that interpersonal
      synchrony can have both an effect on (e.g., increases memory), and can be
      affected by social factors (e.g., higher likeability ratings, more interpersonal
      synchrony). The goal of the present study was to examine whether social factors
      (e.g., popularity, friendship) affect interpersonal synchrony when working
      together. Furthermore, we looked at the relation between interpersonal synchrony
      and learning and likeability.</p>
