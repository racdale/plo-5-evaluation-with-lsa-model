	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A previous study (Hwang et al., 2011) found evidence for semantic
      guidance of visual attention during the inspection of real-world scenes, i.e., an
      influence of semantic relationships among scene objects on overt shifts of
      attention. In particular, the results revealed an observer bias toward gaze
      transitions between semantically similar objects. However, these results are not
      necessarily indicative of semantic processing of individual objects but may be
      confounded by knowledge of the scene gist, which does not require object
      recognition (Torralba et al., 2006), or by known spatial dependency among objects
      (Oliva & Torralba, 2007). To examine the mechanisms underlying semantic guidance,
      in the present study, subjects were asked to view a series of displays with the
      scene gist removed and spatial dependency varied. Our results confirm the
      previous finding of semantic guidance and show that it is not entirely due to
      either the effect of scene gist or the spatial dependency among objects. Even
      without scene gist or spatial dependency, subjects still retrieved semantic
      information to guide their attention. This strategy may facilitate scene
      understanding and object memorization.</p>
