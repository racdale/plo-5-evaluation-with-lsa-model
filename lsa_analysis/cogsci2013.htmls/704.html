	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper explores two current issues in human conditioning: It
      addresses whether human Pavlovian conditioning is the product of a single
      propositional system (Mitchell, De Houwer, & Lovibond, 2009) or dual-systems; one
      propositional in nature and dependent on logical reasoning, the other functional,
      link-based, and dependent on statistical contingency (McLaren, Green, &
      Mackintosh, 1994). Additionally, the current experiment provides insight into the
      processes underlying both A-B-A and A-B-C contextual renewal in humans; a process
      that is often explained using functional (Bouton, 2004; Pearce, 2002) or
      propositional (Havermans, Keuker, Lataster, & Jansen, 2005) accounts.
      Participants were exposed to an electrodermal contextual renewal paradigm in a
      bi-conditional design, whilst measures of both conscious expectancy and autonomic
      skin response were collected. Our results demonstrated that, despite successful
      acquisition and extinction for both measures, contextual renewal was only
      observed for conscious expectancy in the A-B-A renewal condition.</p>
