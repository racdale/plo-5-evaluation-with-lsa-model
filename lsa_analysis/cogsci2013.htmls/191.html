	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this article we demonstrate how algorithmic probability theory
      is applied to situations that involve uncertainty. When people are unsure of
      their model of reality, then the outcome they observe will cause them to update
      their beliefs. We argue that classical probability cannot be applied in such
      cases, and that subjective probability must instead be used. In Experiment 1 we
      show that, when judging the probability of lottery number sequences, people apply
      subjective rather than classical probability. In Experiment 2 we examine the
      conjunction fallacy and demonstrate that the materials used by Tversky and
      Kahneman (1983) involve model uncertainty. We then provide a formal mathematical
      proof that, for every uncertain model, there exists a conjunction of outcomes
      which is more subjectively probable than either of its constituents in isolation.
