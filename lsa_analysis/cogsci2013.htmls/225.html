	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When two persons participate in a discussion, they not only
      exchange the concepts and ideas they are discussing, they also express attitudes,
      feelings and commitments regarding their partner: they express interpersonal
      stances. Endowed with backchannel model, several virtual agents are able to react
      to
      their partners&#8217; behaviour through their non-verbal behaviour. In this
      paper, we go beyond this approach, proposing and testing a model that enables
      agents to express a dyadic stance, marker of effective communication: agents will
      naturally co-construct a shared dyadic stance if and only if their interpersonal
      stance is reciprocally positive. We focus on smile, which conveys interpersonal
      stance and is a particularly efficient signal for co-regulation of communication.
      With this model, a virtual agent, only capable to control its own individual
      parameters, can, in fact, modulate and control the dyadic stance
      appearing when it interacts with its partner. The evaluation of the model through
      a user perceptive study has enabled us to validate that the dyadic stance is
      significantly perceived as more positive (mutual understanding, attention,
      agreement, interest, pleasantness) when reinforcement of smile is reciprocal.
