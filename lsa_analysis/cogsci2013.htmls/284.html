	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Behavioral mimicry is the nonconscious copying of an interaction
      partner&#8217;s behavior and is affected by social dynamics. Whereas it has been
      studied extensively in adults, little is known about the development of mimicry.
      The aims of this study were twofold, first to identify whether young children
      demonstrate mimicry and, second, to investigate whether young children&#8217;s
      mimicry displays sensitivity to social dynamics. Using a video-based paradigm,
      40-month-old children observed six types of behaviors (i.e. yawning, laughing,
      frowning, cheek-scratching, mouth-rubbing and head-wiggling) performed by a model
      which they had previously seen either helping or hindering another model. Results
      indicate that children carried out five of the six behaviors more often while
      watching the behavior videos than during baseline. However, no differences were
      found between the two social manipulations. We conclude that young children
      demonstrate mimicry like that reported in adults and discuss the possible causes
      of the absence of a social effect.</p>
