	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Insightful problem solving is a vital part of human thinking, yet
      very difficult to grasp. The &#8220;Aha! experience&#8221; is often regarded as
      the defining characteristic of insight. Traditionally, insight has been
      investigated by using a set of established &#8220;insight tasks&#8221;, assuming
      that insight has taken place if these problems are solved. However, the debate
      about which problems actually trigger insight is still not resolved, since there
      is no clear behavioural marker for the occurrence of insight. In the present
      work, we therefore aimed at testing the validity of three classical insight
      problems by directly asking participants about their solution experiences. Our
      results suggest that participants solve insight problems also without any Aha!
      experience, casting doubt on the common approach of using a priori defined
      insight problems. Consequently, we advocate the use of direct insight ratings by
      participants, determining for each problem individually whether it was solved
      with insight or not.</p>
