	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study investigated the degrees of consistencies in driving
      behavior when operating a real system (real car), a virtual system (high fidelity
      driving simulator), and a laboratory system (computer driving game). The same
      tendency of behavioral consistencies was confirmed among the three systems: i.e.,
      the steering operation demonstrated the highest behavioral consistencies,
      followed by the acceleration and braking operations, respectively. The
      individuality of driving behavior emerged more in the braking and acceleration
      operations than in the steering operation. The same tendency for behavioral
      consistencies of braking, acceleration, and steering operations was confirmed in
      each of the three systems.</p>
