	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Stock-flow (SF) systems involving the accumulation of a stock over
      time are pervasive in many areas of human life. However, people make consistent
      mistakes when regulating such systems, a phenomenon termed SF failure. We
      introduce holistic (global) versus analytic (local) processing as a cognitive
      mechanism underlying the hardly understood SF failure. Using a classic SF problem
      (department store task), we found that (a) solutions to SF problems were up to
      four times higher when a global task format highlighting global structure
      compared to a local task format highlighting local elements was used; (b) a more
      global processing style is connected to higher solution rates to the SF problem;
      and (c) procedurally priming participants with more global processing results in
      higher solution rates to the SF problem. In sum, our results point towards
      global-local processing as a basic explanation for SF failure.</p>
