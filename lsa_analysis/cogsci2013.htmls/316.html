	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Probabilistic models of cognition have enjoyed recent success in
      explaining how people make inductive inferences. Yet, the difficult computations
      over structured representations that are often required by these models seem
      incompatible with the continuous and distributed nature of human minds. To
      reconcile this issue, and to understand the implications of constraints on
      probabilistic models, we take the approach of formalizing the mechanisms by which
      cognitive and neural processes could approximate Bayesian inference.
      Specifically, we show that an associative memory system using sparse, distributed
      representations can be reinterpreted as an importance sampler, a Monte Carlo
      method of approximating Bayesian inference. This capacity is illustrated through
      two case studies: a simple letter reconstruction task, and the classic problem of
      property induction.  Broadly, our work demonstrates that probabilistic models can
      be implemented in a practical, distributed manner, and helps bridge the gap
      between algorithmic- and computational-level models of cognition.</p>
