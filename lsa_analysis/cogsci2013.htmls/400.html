	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>An ignored stimulus is later recognized at enhanced levels if it
      had previously been aligned with a target from a separate task. This has been
      demonstrated using both visual and auditory presentations. Here we extend these
      findings to multisensory conditions. Participants were required to detect
      immediate repetitions in a sound or picture stream while ignoring superimposed
      words presented in the opposite modality (either written or spoken,
      respectively), and then underwent a surprise recognition test for these words.
      Contrary to the previous unisensory examples (Dewald, Sinnett, & Doumas, in
      press; Dewald & Sinnett, 2012), a significant difference between recognition
      rates for target-aligned and non-aligned words was not observed. However, a
      highly significant difference in response latency was observed, with
      target-aligned words being responded to much more quickly. This finding was
      robust and observed when the surprise test was presented in either the visual or
      auditory modalities, as well as across modalities.   </p>
