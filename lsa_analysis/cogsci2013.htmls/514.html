	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We report three experiments that explore the effect of prior
      linguistic knowledge on implicit language learning. Native speakers of English
      and native speakers of Cantonese participated in implicit learning (IL)
      experiments that involved different learning materials. In Experiment 1, both
      participant groups showed evidence of learning a mapping between articles and
      noun animacy. In Experiment 2, neither group showed learning of the mapping
      between articles and a linguistically anomalous concept (the number of capital
      letters in an English word or the number of strokes in a Chinese character). In
      Experiment 3, the Chinese group, but not the English group, showed evidence of
      learning a mapping between articles and a concept derived from the Chinese
      classifier system. It was concluded that first language knowledge affected
      implicit language learning, and that IL, at least when natural language learning
      is concerned, is not a completely unconstrained domain-general mechanism.</p>
