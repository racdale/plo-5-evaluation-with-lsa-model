	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether face age
      and social status information associated with faces have different effects on
      gaze following behaviour as an index of joint attention. Participants were
      instructed to perform goal-directed saccades towards a peripheral stationary
      target, while a task-irrelevant face with averted gaze was presented. Faces of
      three different age groups (younger adults; middle-aged adults; and older adults)
      were associated with fictional r&#233;sum&#233;s which could describe distracters
      as high or low social status people. Results showed that face age affected both
      saccade accuracy and latencies. Social status did not have an effect on accuracy
      and only affected correct saccades with higher latencies by modulating the face
      age effect. It is argued that the overt orienting of joint attention could be
      affected both by perceptual and higher order socio-cognitive factors, but at
      different stages of processing.</p>
