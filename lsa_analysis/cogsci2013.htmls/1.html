	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>External representations of thought&#8212;maps, diagrams,
      sketches, and the like&#8212;are ancient inventions that serve thought and
      communication in numerous ways. A number of cognitive scientists have
      investigated roles these representations play in cognition (see, e.g., Donald,
      1991; Larkin & Simon, 1987; Norman, 1993; Sch&#246;n, 1983). They are created and
      used by school students, by architects and designers, by mathematicians and
      scientists, by musicians, dancers, and artists. People design and use diagrams to
      spatialize thought and make it public, to work through ideas and clarify
      thinking, to reduce working memory load, to communicate ideas to others, to
      promote collaborative work by providing an external representation that can be
      pointed to and animated by gestures and collectively revised. Considerable
      research has shown that well-designed diagrams promote thought, creativity,
      discovery, and communication. Diagrams can map abstract thought to space,
      allowing spatial reasoning to promote abstract reasoning. </p>
