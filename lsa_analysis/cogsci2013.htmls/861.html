	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research has identified systematic sound-to-meaning
      mappings (sound symbolism) in words for object size, shape, and surface
      lightness. In the present study we investigate whether sound is used
      systematically in spatial relational terms in 17 languages, and whether native
      English-speaking individuals can determine the meanings of these terms. In a
      forced-choice task, participants were asked to choose the correct English
      translation for each unfamiliar foreign word. All items were spatial terms with
      either proximal or distal meanings (translations of English 'here', 'there',
      'near', 'far', 'this', 'that'). Participants nominated the correct meanings of
      the words significantly above chance, suggesting that they used sound structure
      to infer meaning. Acoustic analyses were conducted to examine the relation of
      acoustic properties to word meaning, as well as to listeners&#8217; judgments.
      The findings suggest that the sound structure of language can be systematically
      used to mark relational meanings related to space.</p>
