	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present a neural mechanism for interpreting and executing
      visually presented commands.  These are simple verb-noun commands (such as WRITE
      THREE) and can also include conditionals ([if] SEE SEVEN, [then] WRITE THREE). 
      We apply this to a simplified version of our large-scale functional brain model
      &#8220;Spaun&#8221;, where input is a 28x28 pixel visual stimulus, with a
      different pattern for each word.  Output controls a simulated arm, giving
      hand-written answers.  Cortical areas for categorizing, storing, and interpreting
      information are controlled by the basal ganglia (action selection) and thalamus
      (routing).  The final model has ~100,000 LIF spiking neurons.  We show that the
      model is extremely robust to neural damage (40% of neurons can be destroyed
      before performance drops significantly).  Performance also drops for visual
      display times less than 250ms.  Importantly, the system also scales to large
      vocabularies (~100,000 nouns and verbs) without requiring an exponentially large
      number of neurons.</p>
