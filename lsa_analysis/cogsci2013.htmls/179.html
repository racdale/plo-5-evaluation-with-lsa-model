	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Secondary-level students encounter many difficulties in learning
      complex systems with hierarchical levels. Scaffolding is very critical in
      teaching complex systems. We have two complementary research questions on
      scaffolding: 1. How can we chunk and sequence the learning activities in teaching
      complex systems? 2. How can we help students make connections across system
      levels? A simulation-based environment teaching a chemical system was used as the
      research instrument, and the study was conducted at a middle school setting. The
      results showed that the sequencing method following the &#8220;from concrete to
      abstract&#8221; principle produced better recall and comprehension of the system
      concepts (knowledge integration), while the sequencing method aligned with the
      casual structure of the system facilitated the construction of a better causal
      model for transfer. The results also demonstrated that explicit level-bridging
      scaffolding had positive effects on both knowledge integration and learning the
      deep causal structure.  </p>
