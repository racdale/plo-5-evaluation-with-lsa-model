	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Interpersonal interaction, especially in face-to-face
      circumstances, requires coordination (Clark, 1996). This involves many subtle
      behaviors, controlled carefully in the context of another person, from eye
      movements and gestures, to choice of words and beyond. Several new directions
      have pursued this microstructure of interpersonal interaction. First, with
      advances in sensing and computing techniques, we have the capability to process
      visual, audio and other sensory data collected from real-world interactions.
      Second, researchers in developmental robotics have investigated mechanisms of
      interpersonal coordination, to model and implement social systems. Third,
      research on virtual agents has developed new models of embodied human-agent
      interaction. Together these strands of research offer new insight into human
      social dynamics, and the means to implement and test theories in robotics and
      virtual agents. Bringing them together in one workshop is an opportunity to
      convey these new methods, and find shared interests and synergies among different
      approaches and different fields.</p>
