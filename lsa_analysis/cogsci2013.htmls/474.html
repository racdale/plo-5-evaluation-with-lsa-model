	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Episodic future thinking refers to a human cognitive process which
      generates successive predictions of events that are likely to occur in a
      cue-specific context in the future. An emerging view is that semantic memory as
      well as episodic memory contributes to this process, but the exact mechanism
      remains unclear. We built a computational model that learned to predict the next
      event upon a presented event (sequence prediction model). After learning the
      statistical structure in the training sequence, the model was tested for
      generating successive self-predictions of events triggered by a cue. The
      generated sequence of events captured some phenomenological features of patients
      with semantic dementia when the semantic system of the model was damaged. The
      role of semantics in episodic future thinking and the usefulness of a sequence
      prediction model are discussed.</p>
