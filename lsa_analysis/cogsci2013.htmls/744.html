	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many common words have spatial associations (e.g.,
      &#8220;bird,&#8221; &#8220;snake,&#8221; &#8220;jump&#8221;, &#8220;crawl&#8221;)
      that influence perception at congruent and incongruent locations. For example,
      &#8220;bird&#8221; hinders identification of a square at the top of a display.
      Many researchers have attributed this spatial interference to location-specific
      perceptual simulations: The word &#8220;bird&#8221; shifts attention upward and
      evokes the perceptual representation of a bird, which impairs identification of
      an unrelated visual target either by visually masking it or by engaging the
      neural systems necessary for visual perception. However, we report that a large
      sample of nouns (Experiment 1) and verbs (Experiment 2) of high and low
      imageability (and visual strength) elicited equivalent spatial interference.
      Thus, perceptual simulation failed to explain the spatial interference effect.
      Experiment 3 instead supported an event coding explanation: Target objects are
      coded for their congruence with both the cue word and its implied location, and
      conflicting codes interfere with responding. </p>
