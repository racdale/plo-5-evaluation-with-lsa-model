	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It has been suggested that in creative activities, cognition and
      physical action are related to each other. This study focuses on this
      relationship in breakdance, which is a creative activity of artistic and
      acrobatic movements. For four months, we conducted field observations of practice
      sessions of three expert breakdancers, and held interviews with them to
      investigate the creation process of new and original movements. The video records
      of the 34 practices and the interview data were analyzed with respect to two
      aspects: 1) Whether or not the dancers performed important movements
      appropriately; and 2) What the dancers were thinking when generating new aspects
      of the movements. The results show an interactive process between the development
      of dance movements and the generation of ideas. The dancers gradually became able
      to perform the movements appropriately by generating new ideas, and they
      generated new ideas using the somatic sensation of the new movements.</p>
