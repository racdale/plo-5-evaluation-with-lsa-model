	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Several scholars, e.g. Sellars (1956), Meltzoff & Gopnik (1993),
      have construed the attribution of experiences as being governed by a
      folk-psychological theory in which experiences function as theoretical entities.
      However, so far this claim has not been convincingly supported by an account of
      how people infer the existence of experiences. In this paper I argue that the
      mechanisms that lead to the stipulation of experiences are fundamentally
      inferential and are applied in both self-attribution and third-person attribution
      of experiences. The two most common sources for going through such inferential
      processes are (i) disagreements between two people in how the world is presented
      to them, (ii) being aware of or suspecting differences between how the world is
      presented to a person and extraneous information the person has about the world.
      From situations like these, I show that &#8216;experience&#8217; is a
      theoretically-acquired concept which refers to entities that play an explanatory
      role in virtue of fulfilling two conditions: a person entertains the concept
      experience if that person makes an appearance-reality distinction (C1) and
      considers the appearance to be subjective (C2). </p>
