	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Belief revision is required when new facts are incompatible with
      existing beliefs. In the present experiment, participants changed their mind
      about the spatial and non-spatial relations between objects. The participants
      received information about relations, which were subsequently contradicted by
      irrefutable counterfacts. The task was to decide which of the initial relations
      to retain and which ones to give up. Previous experiments showed that these
      decisions are guided by the linguistic asymmetry between located (LO) and
      reference objects (RO). Reasoners have a strong preference to relocate the LO of
      the counterfactual relation. Our experiment explores whether this robust effect
      can be overwritten by the plausibility of revised beliefs; and how
      visualizability of problems affects revision. We found the LO-preference to be
      robust even when the resulting representation is implausible; and that revision
      is impeded when problems are easy to visualize. The results shed new light on
      relational belief revision in humans.</p>
