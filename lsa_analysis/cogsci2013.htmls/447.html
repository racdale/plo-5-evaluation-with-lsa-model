	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Apprehending the development of complex emotions is crucial to
      understand the development of decision-making. Regret and relief are complex
      counterfactual emotions, which can arise in private or in social contexts. The
      aims of the present study were (i) to uncover the development of regret and
      relief and (ii) to explore the development of a social form of regret and relief
      in a context of competition. The first experiment provides evidence that the
      ability to experience regret and relief continues to develop until adolescence,
      consistent with the implication of the orbitofrontal cortex in their experience.
      In a context of competition, we observed that adolescents were less able to
      experience social regret compared to children and adults, whereas their feeling
      of social relief was reinforced. Besides, adolescents failed to question the
      appropriateness of their initial decision. This result could provide an
      explanation for adolescents&#8217; enhanced propensity to engage in risky
      behaviours.</p>
