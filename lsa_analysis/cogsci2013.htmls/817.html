	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research has shown that auditory training helps
      non-native speakers learn to perceive difficult phonemic contrasts in a second
      language (L2) (Hirata, 2004), but there is much room for improvement. Given that
      hand gestures influence many aspects of native language processing (Hostetter,
      2011), we examined whether imitating versus observing gestures helps to improve
      native English speakers&#8217; ability to perceive novel phoneme contrasts in
      Japanese as an L2. Participants were assigned to either a gesture observe or
      gesture imitate training condition. There was no overall training advantage of
      imitating gestures over simply observing them. However, in a preliminary analysis
      of a sub-group of participants with low scores on the auditory pretest, observing
      gestures was actually more beneficial than imitating them on an ERP post-test of
      auditory perception. The results suggest that producing gestures does not always
      help with learning, and for particularly challenging auditory perceptual tasks,
      may actually interfere with it.</p>
