	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Category information is used to predict unknown properties of
      category members. Previous research has found that when categorization is
      uncertain, property predictions do not reflect integration of information across
      categories as normative principles and Bayesian models would suggest. Rather,
      people often base their predictions on only the most likely category and
      disregard information from less likely ones. Research in category-based induction
      tends to elicit explicit, verbal responses which may not readily allow for
      integration of information across categories. This paper explores whether
      changing response mode can promote more normative use of category information in
      induction. Experiment 1 used an implicit measure of prediction: eye movements.
      The results suggest that when making predictions implicitly people integrate
      information across categories. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the
      integration of information found in Experiment 1 were not a result of explicit
      strategies.</p>
