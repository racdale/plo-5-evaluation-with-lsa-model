	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When constructing a mind, what are the basic materials, structures
      and blueprints a young child has to work with? Are most of the structures already
      in place, with children merely working to embellish them?  Do children begin with
      several buildings already in place (the Physics Building, the Social Building,
      the Number building, etc.), and only decorate a bit as they get older, perhaps
      building bridges between them using language? Such a view might describe a strong
      innate core hypothesis (Spelke et al., 1994). Or does the child begin with more
      of an empty plain, and an ability to construct whatever is necessary out of
      whatever materials are at hand at the time? Such a view might be more along the
      lines of classic empiricism (Quine, 1964).</p>
