	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Our research aimed at investigating whether 8-to-12-year-old
      children spontaneously make the conventional implicature induced by
      &#8216;but&#8217; -combined with &#8216;so&#8217; and &#8216;nevertheless&#8217;-
      in &#8216;p but q&#8217; sentences. We presented the children with stories ending
      with a &#8216;p but q&#8217; sentence. They were instructed to indicate the
      &#8216;appropriate&#8217; conclusion introduced by either &#8216;so&#8217; or
      &#8216;nevertheless&#8217;. In addition, we measured children&#8217;s working
      memory (WM)-capacity in order to explore the possibility that making these
      inferences is effortful. Our results show that children do make the inferences to
      a certain extent but are sensitive to the content of the arguments. Whenever the
      p- or q-argument is an absurd argument (contrasted with a sensible argument),
      this argument almost always gets ignored in favor of the sensible argument,
      irrespective of the &#8216;appropriate&#8217; conclusion &#8216;but&#8217;
      directs the reader to. No reliable WM-effect was found. High WM-span children did
      not make the inference more often than low WM-span children.</p>
