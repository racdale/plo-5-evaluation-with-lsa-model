	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Comparison of the ability of different computational cognitive
      models to simulate empirical data should ideally take into account the complexity
      of the compared models. Although several comparison methods are available that
      are meant to achieve this, little information on the differential strengths and
      weaknesses of these methods is available. In this contribution we present the
      results of a systematic comparison of 5 model comparison methods. Employing model
      recovery simulations, the methods are examined with respect to their ability to
      identify the model that actually generated the data across 3 pairs of models and
      a number of comparison situations. The simulations reveal several interesting
      aspects of the considered methods such as, for instance, the fact that in certain
      situations methods perform worse than model comparison neglecting model
      complexity. Based on the identified method characteristics, we derive a
      preliminary recommendation on when to use which of the 5 methods.</p>
