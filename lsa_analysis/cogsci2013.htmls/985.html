	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present research aimed at identifying cognitive processing
      that works at the initial stage of letter identification. First, we used the word
      superiority effect task to set the baseline of visual detection rate and then we
      used the letter matching task to evaluate the phonemic transference rate of the
      particpants. It was hypothesized that physically-different letters required
      longer processing time as the judgment depended not only on visual detection, but
      also on a process of phonemic transference. Our results found that the control
      group had a higher letter identification rate than the dyslexic group, showing
      that visual detection rate was a good predictor of reading disability. However,
      phonemic transference rate was not a good predictor of dyslexia. One of the
      reasons may be that the process of letter identification involved cognitive
      skills other than that of phonemic transference alone.</p>
