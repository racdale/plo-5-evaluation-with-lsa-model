	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Cognitive developmental research has documented that children
      acquire rich knowledge about the physical and psychological world before they are
      exposed to science, and that learning science requires substantial ontological,
      epistemological and representational changes to happen in the conceptual system
      of the child.  For example, Vosniadou & Skopeliti (2005) showed that while the
      majority of third grade children categorized the earth as a physical object
      distinct from solar objects like the sun and the moon, 90%  percent of 5th
      graders categorized the earth as an astronomical object, belonging to the same
      category as the sun and the moon. In the present research we will present two
      novel, chronometric, tasks for assessing the conceptual re-organizations that
      take place as children are exposed to systematic science instruction and for
      further exploring the question of whether naive theories are overwritten or
      survive and continue to exist together with the scientific theories.
