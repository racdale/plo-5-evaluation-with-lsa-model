	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Humans are exquisitely sensitive to social interactions. This
      study explored whether this extends to interactions in music performance. Jazz
      musicians are fluent at working together to produce music that is more than the
      sum of its parts, and listeners claim anecdotally to hear when musicians are
      &#8216;in the groove&#8217;. We employed jazz-standard duets varying in the
      opportunity for collaboration (two-way, one-way, none), to test listeners&#8217;
      perception of collaboration. In experiment 1, participants rated random
      selections from these recordings in the dimensions of synergy, creativity,
      emotionality, and engagement. Results showed considerable sensitivity to
      collaboration, with sensitivity varying both with social intelligence and musical
      training of the participant. In experiment 2, participants made explicit
      judgments of whether the selections involved collaboration, with the results
      showing they could not. We conclude that the degree of collaboration in joint
      musical performances influences the implicit experience of listeners, but is not
      accessible for explicit judgments.</p>
