	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Advances in developmental research has made it clear
      that word learning has a long beginning. Recent work
      has demonstrated that infants learn words at 6 months
      of age&#8212;that is, before the traditional &#8220;first word&#8221; milestone
      in productive language&#8212;which is a full year before
      the usual &#8220;naming explosion&#8221; in productive vocabulary.
      Before infants talk, walk, or even point, how can the
      earliest stage of word learning take place at all? We
      used recent technology that allowed us to zoom in on the
      point of view of infants and also the traditional roomview
      observations to document how infants&#8217; visual input
      is dynamically synchronized with their own participation,
      as well as from social input in the context of parent-child
      word learning play. The parents&#8217; task was to play with
      the child with a set of toys as they taught the toys to
      them. To specifically document the child&#8217;s dominant
      view and their participation, we coded the size of the
      toy object on which the child was focused and who was
      manipulating the toy at the moment. The results reveal
      systematic and dynamic links between infants&#8217; view and
      their level of participation.</p>
