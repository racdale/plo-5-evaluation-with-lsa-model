	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How do we make sense of the 43 million or 1.3 billion dollar
      budget cuts that are being made in Congress? Large quantities such as these are
      common in our political discourse, yet recent studies demonstrate substantial and
      systematic biases in evaluating them (Landy, Silbert & Goldin 2012). We explore
      how the integration of numerical and political information affects voters&#8217;
      evaluation of political scenarios, and more specifically the effect of number
      training on this evaluation. The current study investigates the effects of a
      number training intervention on the numerical estimation task and evaluation of
      deficit-reducing proposals using a within-subjects design and a typical voting
      population. Participants in the training condition completed a number estimation
      task (Siegler & Opfer 2003) and were shown the accurate location of 1 million on
      a number line from 10 thousand to 1 billion. Line estimation and situation
      evaluation were assessed before and after the intervention. </p>
