	<h1>Purity and Disgust: Same Domain, or Separate Mechanisms?</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We argue that much recent literature on disgust, dirtiness and
      purity has been guilty of conflating two evolved mechanisms: an oral disgust
      mechanism aimed at avoiding the ingestion of dangerous substances, and a
      self-grooming (cleanliness) mechanism aimed at eliminating ectoparasites from the
      skin. Though phylogenetically distinct, these two mechanisms become associated in
      human ontogeny due to their similar targets and overlapping image schemas: one
      focused on the mouth, the other on the body as a whole. We show that several
      puzzles in the literature on disgust and moral purity can be resolved using this
      model. The idea of contamination so central to purity norms may more plausibly be
      based on grooming responses to ectoparasites than on disgust responses to
      endoparasites. The disgust image schema may more easily be extended to moral
      judgements about others, while the cleanliness schema is more easily extended to
      judgements about the self, with interesting consequences.</p>
