	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The question how agent and patient roles are assigned to causal
      participants has largely been neglected in the psychological literature on force
      dynamics. Based on the linguistic theory of Dowty (1991), we propose that agency
      is a prototype concept. We adapted Dowty&#8217;s theory to account for scenarios
      showing physical interactions. In the standard Michotte launching scenario the
      ball entering the scene is usually assigned the agent role, whereas the ball that
      is being launched is viewed as the patient. We showed in two experiments that
      agency intuitions were moderated by manipulations of the context prior to the
      launching event. Altering features such as relative movement, sequence of
      visibility, and self-propelled motion tended to increase agency attributions to
      the patient relative to the standard scenario. We suspect that shifts in
      figure-ground perceptions, and intuitions about characteristics of interventions
      may be the overarching reason for the efficacy of the tested criteria.</p>
