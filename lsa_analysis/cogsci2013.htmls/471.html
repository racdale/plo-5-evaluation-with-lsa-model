	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study investigates whether viewing human gestures facilitates
      learning about non-human biological movements and whether correspondence between
      gesture and to-be-learned movement is superior to non-correspondence. Functional
      near-infrared-spectroscopy was used to address whether gestures activate the
      human mirror-neuron-system (hMNS) and whether this activation mediates the
      facilitation of learning. During learning participants viewed triples of
      visualizations (animation &#8211; gesture video &#8211; animation). Results
      showed that for low-visuospatial-ability learners corresponding gestures led to
      higher cortical activation in the inferior-frontal cortex (part of the hMNS) and
      better learning outcomes, whereas for high-visuospatial-ability learners the type
      of gesture had no influence. Furthermore, results showed that &#8211; if
      presented with non-corresponding gestures &#8211; only low-visuospatial-ability
      learners who activated their inferior-parietal cortex (also part of the hMNS),
      improve their learning. Thus, activating the hMNS facilitates learning about
      movements and stimulating the hMNS via gestures seems to be an adequate
      instructional strategy to enhance learning with dynamic visualizations for
      low-visuospatial-ability learners.</p>
