	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigate the effect of linguistic complexity on cognitive
      load in a dual-task scenario, namely simultaneous driving and language use. To
      this end, we designed an experiment where participants use a driving simulator
      while listening to spoken stimuli and answering comprehension questions. Online
      physiological measures of cognitive load, including the recently established
      Index of Cognitive Activity, as well as measures of performance in both tasks
      have been collected with high temporal resolution. The resulting aligned data
      streams can be used to test a vast array of different hypotheses about the
      relationship between performance, difficulty, and cognitive load in dual tasks at
      various levels of temporal resolution and linguistic structure. We present
      results of the data analysis, including evidence that different linguistic
      structures may cause measurable changes in cognitive workload on a very fine
      temporal scale in cases of increased primary task difficulty.
