	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present a novel learning rule for learning transformations of
      sophisticated neural representations in a biologically plausible manner. We show
      that the rule can learn to transmit and bind semantic pointers. Semantic pointers
      have previously been used to build Spaun, which is currently the world&#8217;s
      largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012) and can perform several
      complex cognitive tasks. The learning rule combines a previously proposed
      supervised learning rule and a novel spiking form of the BCM unsupervised
      learning rule. We show that spiking BCM increases sparsity of connection weights
      at the cost of increased signal transmission error. We demonstrate that the
      combined learning rule can learn transformations as well as the supervised rule
      alone, and as well as the offline optimization used previously. We also
      demonstrate that the combined learning rule is more robust to changes in
      parameters and leads to better outcomes in higher dimensional spaces.</p>
