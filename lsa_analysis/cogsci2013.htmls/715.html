	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research has well-documented that na&#239;ve learners
      struggle when attempting to understand emergent phenomena. Misconceptions often
      arise as learners tend to apply patterns of cause-and-effect between entities to
      explain these emergent processes. We posited that comprehending emergence
      requires learners to construct a different conceptual model, namely a functional
      schema, emphasizing functional relationships among entities and their
      interactions that are central to how emergent phenomena arise. A promising
      strategy to promote generation of such functional schema is contrasting examples.
      This paper reported an intervention study with 86 middle school students
      examining the effect of contrasting scenarios in helping learners generate a
      functional-relationship-centered schema to understand global warming.
      Students&#8217; correct and misconceived explanations in pretest-posttest
      protocols were analyzed. Results showed contrasting scenarios motivated learners
      to develop the critical functional schema, which led to their eventual
      understanding of the mechanism of global warming. Implications on schema
      construction on understanding emergent systems are discussed.</p>
