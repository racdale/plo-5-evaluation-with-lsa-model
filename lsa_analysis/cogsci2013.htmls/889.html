	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>What are the &#8220;cognitive after-effects&#8221; of making a
      similarity judgement? What, cognitively, is left behind and what effect might
      these residues have on subsequent processing?  In this paper, we probe for such
      after-effects using a visual search task, performed after a task in which
      pictures of real-world objects were compared. So, target objects were first
      presented in a comparison task (e.g., rate the similarity of this object to
      another) thus, presumably, modifying some of their features before asking people
      to visually search for the same object in complex scenes (with distractors and
      camouflaged backgrounds). As visual search is known to be influenced by the
      features of target objects, then any after-effects of the comparison task should
      be revealed in subsequent visual searches. Results showed that when people
      previously rated an object as being high on a scale (e.g., colour similarity or
      general similarity) then visual search is inhibited (slower RTs and more saccades
      in eye-tracking) relative to an object being rated as low in the  same scale.
      There was also some evidence that different comparison tasks (e.g., compare on
      colour or compare on general similarity) have differential effects on visual
      search.</p>
