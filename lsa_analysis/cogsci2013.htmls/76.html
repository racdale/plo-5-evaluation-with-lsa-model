	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of the social
      factors among the different forces which influence natural selection. To do this,
      we&#8217;ll start analyzing an example of highly complex society, like that of
      the baboons, in order to show that the building-up of a society depends on
      extremely flexible and continually negotiated social relationships, rather than
      on features that are genetically determined. However, in our view, when we shift
      from animal societies to the human ones, we have to recognize the central role of
      language. In fact, even if the role of social influence appears to be relevant in
      other animal species, in humans it was language that provided the way to make
      this social influence much more important, to redefine the roles, to reverse the
      genetic dominances even more, and to make human cooperation something unique.</p>
