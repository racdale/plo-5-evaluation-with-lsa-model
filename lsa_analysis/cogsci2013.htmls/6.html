	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>There has been tremendous growth recently in theories that attempt
      to provide more comprehensive accounts of the foundational mechanisms of human
      cognition. Such theories have taken a variety of forms, and have focused on
      different levels of analysis. The diversity is important and necessary, but can
      serve as a barrier to interaction, comparison, and integration, even at venues
      like the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society that should foster such
      dialogue. This workshop is intended to bring together individuals working on
      integrative models of human cognition, to emphasize shared motivations and goals.
      Ultimately, building scientific communities that bridge levels of analysis,
      methodologies, and theoretical approaches to work toward more comprehensive
      theories will be critical to the addressing the central goal of the Cognitive
      Science Society &#8211; understanding the nature of the human mind.</p>
