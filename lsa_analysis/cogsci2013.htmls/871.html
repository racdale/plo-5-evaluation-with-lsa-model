	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study examined how the presentation of similar
      situation to character&#8217;s situation would support children&#8217;s empathic
      understandings toward character. According to Barnes & Thagard(1997), people find
      similar situation of which the target is in, and transfer the emerging emotional
      state to target to understand his feelings empathically. Therefore, it was
      expected that teacher&#8217;s presentation of similar situation to
      character&#8217;s situation would scaffold children&#8217;s understandings toward
      character&#8217;s feelings. Sixth graders&#8217; 6 moral education lessons were
      observed and speeches were recorded. The scenes, where similar situations to
      character&#8217;s situations were provided by teacher and used by children, were
      analyzed. As a result of qualitative analysis, the followings were found: 1)
      Children who had difficulties in understanding characters&#8217; feelings were
      able to imagine it by using presented similar situations. 2) Teacher presented
      similar situations to emphasize not only &#8220;similarity&#8221;, but
      &#8220;differences&#8221; between situations to prompt children&#8217;s
      understandings toward characters.</p>
