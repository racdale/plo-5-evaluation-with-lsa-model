	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Behaviorism and Cognitivism are two perspectives in cognitive
      science that have had significant impact in the evolution of mind theory.
      Behaviorism is centered in the study of mind from the perspective of externalized
      behavior. Behaviorism is opposed to the approach to mind analysis from an
      introspective point of view, even rejecting the existence of internal states. 
      The cognitivist reaction explained some aspects of memory and learning that
      behaviorism failed to account for. Internal mental states &#8211;beliefs, values,
      intentions- are the common trade of cognitivist models. Cognitivism employs
      computer-based information processing as the paradigmatic principle sustaining
      cognitive modeling, where data structures implement the required internal mental
      states. These two approaches to cognitive science are usually considered as
      antagonistic; but they are not. The only difference is that they approach the
      problem of the modeling of mind from an input/output perspective or from a
      state-based perspective. Behaviorism focuses on using a black box model of minds
      while cognitivism focuses on white box models. Both are right and complementary
      approaches and are degenerate forms of a more fundamental approach that may be
      applied to mind modeling: systems identification. </p>
