	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>While formal theories of language consider function words to have
      little semantic content, more recent theoretical work has argued that even
      function words have meaning. Yet, there is little experimental work on the
      representations underlying the meaning of function words such as conjunctions. In
      two offline experiments, we examined whether conjunctions (and, or, but,
      either&#8230;or) are associated in systematic but distinctive ways with spatial
      information. In Experiment 1, participants drew schematic representations to
      depict how two abstract conjuncts might be connected by each of the four
      conjunctions. These drawing were evaluated on three spatial dimensions (distance,
      containment and size). In Experiment 2, participants evaluated how well schematic
      sketches (that differed in distance, containment, and size) represented different
      conjunctions. In both experiments, spatial information was systematically and
      distinctively associated with conjunctions. Either&#8230; or and or conjunctions
      were reliably associated with the use of large distance and separation via
      containment of the conjuncts. And, by contrast, was associated with shorter
      distance between, and no containment of, the conjuncts.  Finally, but was
      associated with differences in size. We discuss implications of these results for
      the spatial foundation of linguistic meaning, and the link between lexical
      semantics and logic.</p>
