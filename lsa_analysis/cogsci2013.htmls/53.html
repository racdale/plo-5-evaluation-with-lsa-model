	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Ratcliff, Van Zandt, and McKoon (1999, Psych. Rev.) claim that
      connectionist models fail to simulate many aspects of how individuals select one
      of two possible responses. Here, these claims are re-evaluated via computational
      and behavioral investigations of an extended version of the original numerosity
      judgment task. The results of the experiment indicate that some of the empirical
      effects that the models failed to capture do not generalize and were likely due
      to idiosyncratic aspects of the original methodology. The simulations show that a
      more biologically-plausible model captures the bulk of the new effects, including
      some trial-by-trial adaptive effects that are outside the scope of models tested
      against aggregate data, and emergent asymptotic stability that has previously
      required an explicit leak parameter.</p>
