	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Reading complex graphs has been shown to be difficult for diverse
      groups of participants from different backgrounds and different levels of
      expertise in the task domain. This study investigated the impact of temporal and
      spatial task aspects for reducing complexity and increasing performance for a
      surgical task with medical students. 

      85 premedical and medical students solved an anatomy test on the gallbladder, a
      test on the steps of the procedure of removing the gallbladder, and a test
      combining both in a web-based survey. For all 3 tasks, performance increases with
      years in college. More interestingly, medical students performed best for the
      combined task and worst for the anatomy task.

      This implies students could use temporal and spatial relationships to overcome
      knowledge gaps to solve the complex task. Having an idea what to do first and
      where to do it, helped students to reconstruct a complex surgical task.
