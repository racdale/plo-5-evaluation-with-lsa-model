	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In times of globalization, differences between cultures and in the
      interpretation of linguistic terms can lead to misunderstanding in communication.
      The present study focuses on the influence of cultural dimensions, especially
      uncertainty avoidance, on the interpretation of verbal probability expressions.
      It is hypothesized that uncertainty avoidance has an effect on the interpretation
      of uncertainty expressions. Therefore, Spanish and German participants were asked
      (1) for uncertainty avoidance and (2) to estimate numerical equivalents for 12
      verbal probability expressions (e.g., possible). The estimation data were modeled
      using fuzzy membership functions. Results neither show differences in uncertainty
      avoidance nor in the interpretation of the probability expressions between these
      two languages. Possible reasons and future research perspectives are
      discussed.</p>
