	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated whether &#8220;embodiment&#8221; of objects used
      in a problem-solving task (i.e., whether they have a bodily shape) would have a
      detrimental effect on learning to solve that problem through practice or through
      studying video-based modeling examples. A 2x2 design with factors Training
      (Practice/Example study) and Embodiment (Present/Absent) was used (N = 80).
      Results showed a large main effect of Training on effort investment in learning
      and on retention test performance, with Example study leading to higher scores
      with lower investment of effort during the learning phase than Practice.
      Numerically, Embodiment seemed to have an effect, with participants
      practicing/studying the task with embodied objects (plastic animals) performing
      worse on retention than participants practicing/ studying with non-embodied
      objects (discs), but this did not reach statistical significance. A new study
      with more power and an additional control condition is currently being conducted
      and results are expected to be available well before the conference.</p>
