	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A growing literature suggests that readers generate predictions
      about various aspects of incoming linguistic input. Do expectations from context
      map onto lower-level expectations, and if so, how? We propose that comprehenders
      use internally generated predictions to explain the source of the input. In two
      experiments, we tracked eye-movements as subjects read sentences that generated
      strong (The boy saved the xxx) or weak (Mary had the word &#8220;xxx&#8221;
      tattooed &#8230;) expectations for nouns. Across contexts, subjects encountered
      target words (xxx) that had visual-form features that were either typical or
      atypical of nouns. In strongly predictive contexts, first-fixation and gaze
      duration measures were longer when the form of the target word was atypical with
      respect to the predicted category. In the less-biased contexts, no effect of
      word-form typicality occurred. These experiments provide eye-movement evidence
      that linguistic context is used to generate perceptual expectations about
      form-based properties of upcoming words during reading.</p>
