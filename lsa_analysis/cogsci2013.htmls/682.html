	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Studies of statistical learning have documented a remarkable
      sensitivity to structural regularities in both infants and adults. However, most
      studies of statistical learning have assumed a single underlying causal structure
      with uniform variance. In previous work in which two structures are presented
      successively, a primacy effect has been reported in which only the first
      structure is acquired. The present study explores the conditions under which such
      primacy effects are observed and learners are capable of acquiring both
      structures. We argue that learners can detect multiple structures by monitoring
      the consistency of the input.</p>
