	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research on numerical cognition suggests a strong link between
      mental representations of space and quantity. The SNARC effect (Spatial-Numerical
      Association of Response Codes effect) is characterized by the association of
      small quantities with left space and large quantities with right space. While the
      majority of research on the spatial representation of number has been on number
      words or Arabic numerals, this study investigates quantity representations that
      are involved in the processing of grammatical number. We found that German words
      that were inflected for singular had a relative left hand advantage, and
      conversely, plurals had a relative right-hand advantage. However, this pattern
      was only found in relatively late responses. Moreover, it appeared to interfere
      with the opposite pattern caused by the MARC effect (Markedness Association of
      Response Codes effect) leading to a relative right-hand advantage for singulars.
      This interference appeared to depend mainly on response latency with MARC effects
      being more pronounced in early responses and SNARC-like effects being more
      pronounced in late responses. This work sheds light on the interaction of
      different stimulus-to-response mappings operating on the same stimulus dimension
      &#8211; grammatical number. Moreover, it suggests that spatial numerical
      associations go beyond explicit numerical information, as in number words or
      Arabic numerals. </p>
