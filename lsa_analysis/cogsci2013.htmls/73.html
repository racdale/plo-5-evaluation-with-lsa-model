	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In the two-envelope problem a reasoner is offered two envelopes,
      one containing exactly twice the money in the other. After observing the amount
      in one envelope it can be traded for the unseen contents of the other. Until
      recently it was argued that it did not matter whether the envelope was traded or
      not, but Abbott, Davis & Parrondo (2010) showed that gains could be made if
      trading was a probabilistic function of amount observed. Three experiments varied
      where the observed and maximum amounts fell in a possible distribution and tested
      whether this affected choices. Trading was less likely for lower observed amount
      than higher, but this effect differed depending on the stated distribution. This
      suggests that participants&#8217; trade decisions were affected by where
      observations fit in the distribution, and thus their probabilities. The modeling
      tools used here may be applicable to other reasoning phenomena.</p>
