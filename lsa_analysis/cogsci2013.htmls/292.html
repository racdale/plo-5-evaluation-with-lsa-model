	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Children make inductive inferences about the causal properties of
      individual objects from a very young age.  When can they infer higher-order
      relational properties - a task that has proven difficult for non-human primates? 
      In two experiments, we examined 18-24-month-old infants&#8217; relational
      inferences using a causal version of a relational match-to-sample task.  Results
      suggest that by 21-24 months of age, infants are able to infer a relational
      causal principle from just a few observations and use this inference to guide
      their own subsequent actions and bring about a novel causal outcome.  Findings
      are considered in light of recent discussion about the nature of relational and
      causal reasoning, and their evolutionary origins.</p>
