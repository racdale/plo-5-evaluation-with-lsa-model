	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>SRNEngine is a windows-based application package for training
      neural networks.  The graphical user interface allows the drag-and-drop creation
      of neural networks with a variety of architectures, without the need for any
      programming.  At present, these architectures/learning algorithms include Simple
      Recurrent Networks, Jordan networks, and any kind of feedforward backpropagation
      network, with up to five each of input, hidden, and output layers (pools of
      units).  A version that adds backpropagation-through-time is in development. The
      interface is designed to conform to the Microsoft Windows GUI environment that
      most PC users are already familiar with.  SRNEngine includes tools for creating,
      editing, and manipulating various types of training data, and is especially
      optimized for working with text/language data, including automatic
      word-to-input-representation translation at runtime for text corpora.  The
      distributed computing feature allows multiple simulations to be run on a network
      of workstations, co-ordinated via a central ftp server.</p>
