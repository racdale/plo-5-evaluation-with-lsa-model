	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this paper we develop an idea first mooted by Wilkinson, Ball,
      and Cooper (2010), which is that the dichotomy between theory-based and
      simulation-based reasoning in the context of mental state understanding is
      synonymous with the distinction between intuitive and reflective thinking in
      dual-process accounts of human reasoning (e.g., Evans, 2010). To support this
      proposal we draw upon a range of concepts and findings deriving from both
      mainstream reasoning research and from studies of social cognition. We also
      consider the implications of our proposal for the formulation of an integrative
      approach to understanding reasoning in all of its many manifestations, whether
      undertaken for the attainment of socially-oriented goals or for the purposes of
      learning and discovery. </p>
