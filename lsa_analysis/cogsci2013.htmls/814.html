	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many decisions are made under the advice of another person. We
      investigated the environmental circumstances under which two prominent
      strategies&#8212;averaging and choosing&#8212;are effective and adaptive and
      explored how people employ them. We report two experiments, in which participants
      (N = 111 and N = 90, respectively) provided initial estimates for general
      knowledge questions that varied in perceived difficulty. In Experiment 2, they
      additionally received advice in the form of an estimate and confidence rating of
      another person before providing a revised estimate. We found that items of
      different perceived levels of difficulty exhibited distinctive statistical
      properties, thus constituting different social environments. Environmental
      structure affected the theoretical performance of strategies (such as averaging
      and choosing), and the ways, in which people integrate advice. We embed our
      analyses in the frameworks of ecological rationality and the probability,
      accuracy, redundancy (PAR) model of advice taking (Soll & Larrick&#8217;s, 2009;
      JEP:LMC, 35).</p>
