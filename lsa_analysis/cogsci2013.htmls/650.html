	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This article reports on an experiment in which artificial
      languages with whistle words for novel objects are culturally transmitted in the
      laboratory. The aim of this study is to investigate the origins and evolution of
      combinatorial structure in speech. Participants learned the whistled language and
      reproduced the sounds with the use of a slide whistle. Their reproductions were
      used as input for the next participant. Cultural transmission caused the whistled
      systems to become more learnable and more structured. In addition, two conditions
      were studied: one in which the use of iconic form-meaning mappings was possible
      and one in which the use of iconic map- pings was experimentally made impossible,
      so that we could investigate the influence of iconicity on the emergence of
      structure.</p>
