	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How does language knowledge affect processing of paralinguistic
      information&#8212;vocal properties that are not directly related to understanding
      words? This study investigates links between a listener&#8217;s native language,
      any other languages they may have experience in, and the ability to identify
      vocal emotional information in those languages. The study focuses on two
      particular classes of languages: those with lexical tone, such as Mandarin
      Chinese, which use pitch properties to distinguish otherwise-identical words; and
      those without lexical tone, such as English. English listeners and bilingual
      Mandarin-English listeners listened to sentences and categorized the emotional
      content of English and Mandarin sentences. Half of the sentences were presented
      normally; the other half were low-pass filtered to remove all but prosodic cues
      (pitch and timing). English listeners were better at identifying emotions in
      English sentences, while bilinguals were equally good at identifying emotions in
      both languages. This indicates better overall emotion recognition from prosody
      alone for listeners more familiar with a language. It may point to a connection
      between tone language experience and augmented paralinguistic processing
      capabilities. </p>
