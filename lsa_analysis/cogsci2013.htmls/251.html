	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of the current studies was to explore encoding time
      differences in objects and relations and to investigate whether these differences
      lead to differences in allocation of attention to object similarity. Using a
      match-to-sample paradigm with 5- to 6-year-olds and adults, we found that (1)
      objects were encoded faster than relations for both adults and children, and that
      (2) children, but not adults, preferentially allocated attention to object
      similarity. Ultimately, these questions are aimed at identifying the factors
      responsible for the development of adult-like analogical reasoning. We suggest
      that changes in selective attention over development may account for the pattern
      of results seen across these two studies.</p>
