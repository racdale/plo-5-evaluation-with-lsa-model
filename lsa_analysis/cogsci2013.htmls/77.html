	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The current paper examines spatial descriptions provided by older
      adults in the context of a fetch task in a virtual house environment that mimics
      an eldercare setting.  Sixty-four older adults provided directions for how to
      find a target or where to find a target to a robot or human (named Brian) avatar.
       There were systematic differences in the form and structure of the descriptions
      based on the communicative task. Specifically, how descriptions were longer,
      contained more detail, and were dynamically structured as compared to where
      descriptions.  However, where descriptions were found to be more effective in
      conveying the target location, as assessed with a subsequent target selection
      task.  Implications for the development of robot algorithms for the comprehension
      of naturalistic spatial language across these two communicative tasks are
      discussed.</p>
