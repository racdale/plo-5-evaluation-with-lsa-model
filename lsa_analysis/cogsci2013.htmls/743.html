	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Explanation is often cited as an effective learning tool, but much
      work remains to determine the influence of explanations on different types of
      material to be learned. Evidence from category learning suggests that explanation
      may drive the learner to identify underlying regularities that fit a general
      pattern (Williams & Lombrozo, 2010). In a pilot study, we examined whether
      explanation could be used to improve understanding of fraction magnitudes and
      whether explanations of specific inequalities are more or less effective than
      explanations of sets of inequalities. Results revealed that generating single or
      set explanations did not affect test or transfer accuracy, but individuals
      indicated strong and consistent preferences for particular types of explanations
      (i.e. conceptual, procedural, or rule-based). Further studies are being conducted
      to identify individual differences that may predict preferences for different
      kinds of explanations and their effect on subsequent learning and
      understanding.</p>
