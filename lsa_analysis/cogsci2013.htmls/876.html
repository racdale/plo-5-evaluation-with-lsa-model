	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Altruistic punishment has a central role in cooperation among
      humans. People punish uncooperative individuals at a cost to themselves, inducing
      adherence to social norms. Little is known about altruistic punishment comparing
      ingroup and outgroup context. Using fMRI, we studied the behavior of altruistic
      punishment during the Third Party Punishment game. This game shows the behavior
      spending one&#8217;s own money, without any personal benefit, to punish unfair
      behavior of Player A who violate cooperation norms to Player B.This behavior may
      be differently displayed depending on the in-group (Player C and B same
      nationality) versus out-group (Player C and B different nationality) setting, in
      favor to one&#8217;s own group. This attitude is called parochial altruism.
      Preliminary results showed activation of anterior cingolate cortex involved in
      conflict between cognitive and emotional motivations in altruistic punishment.
      Data also show activation of anterior insula that reflects social norm violations
      during unfair ingroup condition.</p>
