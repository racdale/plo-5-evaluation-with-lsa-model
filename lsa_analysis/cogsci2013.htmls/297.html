	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Social learning has been shown to be an evolutionarily adaptive
      strategy, but can be implemented via many different cognitive mechanisms.
      Sensitivity to statistical dependency in the behavior of other people is a factor
      that discriminates between possible mechanisms: blind imitation or simple rule
      based strategies may be unaffected by dependency, while more sophisticated social
      learning strategies should take it into account. We use a Bayesian model to
      determine how rational agents should incorporate the effects of statistical
      dependency when learning from other people, conducting two experiments that
      examine whether human learners behave similarly. We find that people are
      sensitive to two different patterns of dependency, supporting the use of a
      sophisticated strategy for social learning.</p>
