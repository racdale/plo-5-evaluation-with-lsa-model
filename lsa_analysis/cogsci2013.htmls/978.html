	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A critical step in language acquisition is segmenting speech into
      words. Prior cross-linguistic research demonstrates the importance of
      language specific segmentation strategies (Gervain & Erra, 2012).
      English-learning infants can use statistical information to segment
      words in laboratory experiments (Saffran et al., 1996), but its
      informativeness in segmenting English is unclear (Yang & Gambell,
      2004; Swingley, 2005). We analyzed one corpus of 611,837
      child-directed utterances (Theakston et al, 2000; MacWhinney, 2000),
      and one corpus of 50,776 adult-directed utterances (Pitt et al., 2007)
      and found that, in both corpora, a simple strategy that assumes that
      each syllable is a word would be highly effective in segmenting words.
      Accuracy was 69.68% and 61.7% in the child and adult corpora,
      respectively, segmenting 87.44% and 87.90% of the corpora. These
      findings should guide further investigations into the processes
      infants actually use to segment speech, and more broadly how they
      learn appropriate language-specific word segmentation strategies.
