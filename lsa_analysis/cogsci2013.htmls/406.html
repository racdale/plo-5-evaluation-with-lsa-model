	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous accounts of the mechanism which generates improvement in
      memory when people freely choose items, compared to other methods of item
      assignment, conflict and lack integration.  I examine facial recognition
      performance of 40 participants asked to choose either the most or least
      attractive face from a series of pairs, and find that recognition of chosen faces
      is greater than recognition of unchosen, while no effect is found for the valence
      of faces.  Considering these results in tandem with prior results and theories, I
      argue that a two process account of memory improvements due to choice is
      necessary, with one deliberative process occurring across all options available
      to choose from, and the other selective process focused on the actual chosen
      item.  I detail the delineation of these processes, and describe and test the
      current best accounts of each &#8212; the multiple-cue hypothesis, and the
      self-reference effect for memory.</p>
