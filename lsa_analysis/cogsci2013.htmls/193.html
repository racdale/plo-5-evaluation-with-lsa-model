	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How are we able to reason about abstract concepts that lie
      resolutely beyond the reach of perception? One strategy is to ground
      understanding in space. Numbers, for instance, are known to interact with
      egocentric space during rapid numerical judgments. A range of experimental
      results have demonstrated that, among literate Western people, this &#8220;mental
      number-line&#8221; goes from left to right, with smaller numbers associated with
      left space, and larger numbers with right space. But what is the nature of this
      &#8220;space&#8221;? Previous work has conflated multiple possible egocentric
      frames of reference&#8212;head-based, eye-based, action-based&#8212;leaving it
      unclear which space is interacting with number. In the present paper, two studies
      investigated whether a single centrally-located button, stationary in hand- and
      eye-based coordinates, can nevertheless exhibit different spatial properties in
      virtue of task-specific activity. In a go/no-go paradigm, participants judged the
      magnitude (Exp. 1) and parity (Exp. 2) of single-digit numbers. Crucially, they
      responded only with the index or middle finger of a single hand. While judging
      magnitude (Exp. 1), participants were faster to respond to smaller numbers with
      the more leftward finger, and larger numbers with the more rightward finger,
      regardless of the hand being used. This effect disappeared when judging parity
      (Exp. 2), replaced by finger-specific associations on the left hand only. In sum,
      in a task-sensitive way, participants associated numbers with egocentric
      space&#8212;but a behavioral space defined relative to embodied interaction
      rather than head- or eye-based reference frames. We discuss implications for
      number representation and the nature of &#8220;space&#8221; in embodied
      activity.</p>
