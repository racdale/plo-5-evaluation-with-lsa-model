	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Communication systems reliably self-organize in populations of
      interacting agents under certain conditions. The various fields which model this
      - game theory, cognitive science and evolutionary linguistics - make different
      assumptions about the learning and behavioral processes which are responsible. We
      created an exemplar-based framework to directly compare these approaches by
      reproducing previously published models. Results show that a number of mechanisms
      are shared by the systems which can construct optimal communication. Three
      general factors are then proposed to underlie any self-organizing learned system.
