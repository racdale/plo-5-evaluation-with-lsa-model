	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Chess experts remember meaningful chess positions better than
      novices (de Groot, 1978; Chase & Simon, 1973). This can be explained with a
      larger number of chunks in experts' long-term memory (Gobet & Simon, 1998). These
      chunks are mainly based on visual representations, that is, pieces on squares.
      However, a recent experiment highlighted that experts prefer to group chess
      positions by abstract similarities that cannot be explained purely visually
      (Linhares & Brum, 2007). Based on these data it was claimed that chess expertise,
      in addition to chunks, crucially relies on abstraction and analogies. These data
      and the conclusions were heavily criticized because the instructions strongly
      biased the participants to group positions in a certain way (Bilali'c & Gobet,
      2009). Here, we successfully replicated this experiment with less explicit
      instructions. In addition, we collected category labels for the groupings that
      allowed us to explore the abstract principles that participants used.</p>
