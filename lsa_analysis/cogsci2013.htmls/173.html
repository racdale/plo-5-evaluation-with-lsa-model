	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigate pre-schoolers&#8217; ability in drawing pragmatic
      inferences based on prosodic information. Previous work has found that young
      children are generally oblivious to intonational meaning of utterances. In
      particular, the ability to comprehend contrastive prosody develops late during
      language acquisition (after the age of 6). In three experiments, we show that
      preschoolers can engage in prosody-based pragmatic inferences if the context
      provides supports for them. Furthermore, we find that preschoolers&#8217;
      interpretation of prosody involves complex counter-factual reasoning (&#8216;what
      the speaker would have said if she had intended another meaning&#8217;). The
      picture emerging from our studies contrasts with previous work: Through rich
      contextual inferences, four-year olds are able to bootstrap their interpretation
      of prosodic information, and achieve adult like performance in intonation
      interpretation.</p>
