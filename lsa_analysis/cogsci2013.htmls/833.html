	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The nature and basis of creative thought is the subject of
      wide-ranging inquiry, yet remains elusive. We focus on a core issue: why do
      people struggle to solve problems that require a creative insight and what type
      of support can make success into the norm? Drawing on the idea of relational
      encoding (e.g., Gentner, Loewenstein, & Thompson, 2003), we sought to improve
      creative problem solving by activating structured content (relations between
      objects) in the problem encoding. We developed an alternative to a comparison
      task: completing a set of sentence frames explaining how pairs of objects in the
      problem setting relate to one another. In two experiments, we found evidence that
      participants in the relational encoding group were significantly more likely to
      solve an insight problem than controls. An important caveat is that the advantage
      was only found for the easier problems tested - there were no differences for the
      more difficult problems. We address implications of this work from both
      theoretical and applied perspectives.</p>
