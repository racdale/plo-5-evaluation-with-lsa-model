	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Expectations are generated with different degrees of predictive
      uncertainty prior to onset of musical events. This study explored influences of
      genre specific expertise in non-musicians, classical, and jazz musicians
      listening to unfamiliar Charlie Parker solos.

      Two probabilistic computational models of expectation were trained: one on
      folksongs (General), the other on jazz (Bebop). Twenty-four melodies were
      selected whose final notes differed in Shannon entropy estimated by the two
      models. Listeners' uncertainty was assessed explicitly and inferred from
      expectedness ratings of different continuation tones.

      The analysis showed that jazz musicians followed 'Bebop' and non-musicians
      followed 'General'. Classical musicians showed some decoding of the jazz style,
      utilising a somewhat underdeveloped version of 'Bebop'. Moreover, experts
      experienced more salient prediction errors in low-entropy contexts, and musical
      skills predicted the extent of cognitive model optimisation.

      Our results suggest that expertise entails both possessing an accurate predictive
      model and selecting an optimal model for the given context.</p>
