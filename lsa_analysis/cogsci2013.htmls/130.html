	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Language is often regarded as a rich source of evidence about the
      mind. However, a number of findings challenge this position, at least at the
      level of words: Where languages differ in their lexical distinctions, conceptual
      differences are not always observed. We ask here how language might serve as a
      window into the mind despite an apparently loose connection between words and
      concepts. We propose that prominent conceptual distinctions, though not
      necessarily captured by individual words, may be revealed by elements of meaning
      shared by multiple words. Testing this hypothesis in the domain of space, we show
      that clusters of spatial terms, identified through dimensionality reduction
      analyses of semantic similarity data, align with conceptual categories
      spontaneously accessed during the perceptual discrimination of spatial relations.
      These findings suggest that aspects of semantic structure beyond the level of
      words may provide considerable insight into the conceptual system. Implications
      for research on linguistic relativity are discussed.</p>
