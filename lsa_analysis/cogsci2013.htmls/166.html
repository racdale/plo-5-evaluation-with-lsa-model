	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Can our decisions be guided by unconscious or implicit influ-
      ences? According to the somatic marker hypothesis, emotion- based signals guide
      our decisions in uncertain environments outside awareness. However, evidence for
      this claim can be questioned on the grounds of inadequate assessments of
      conscious knowledge. Post-decision wagering, in which participants make wagers on
      the correctness of their decisions, has been recently proposed as an objective
      and sensitive measure of conscious content. In the experiments reported here, we
      employed variations of a classic decision-making paradigm, the Iowa Gambling
      Task, in combination with wagering in order to investigate the role played by
      unconscious influences. We also examined biases that affect wagering strategies
      such as the definition of the optimal strategy and loss aversion. Our results
      demonstrate the inadequacy of post-decision wagering as a direct measure of
      conscious knowledge and also question the claim that implicit processes influence
      decision-making.</p>
