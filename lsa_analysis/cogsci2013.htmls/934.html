	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Efficient visually-guided behavior depends on our ability to form,
      retain, and compare visual representations that may be separated in space and
      time. This ability relies on visual working memory (VWM). Here, we describe a
      layered neural architecture that captures the cortical population dynamics that
      underlie VWM. We then test this model using functional neuroimaging. Recent work
      has shown that the BOLD response is strongly correlated with local field
      potentials (LFPs). An analog of LFPs can be estimated from dynamic neural field
      (DNF) models. This estimate can be convolved with an impulse response function to
      yield time-dependent hemodynamic predictions. Using this approach, we show that
      the DFN model quantitatively captures fMRI data from recent studies probing
      changes in the BOLD response in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as set size
      increases in change detection. We also test a novel prediction of the model that
      BOLD responses should be greater on false alarms versus misses. These data run
      counter to common explanations of the origin of errors in change detection.</p>
