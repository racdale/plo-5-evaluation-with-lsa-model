	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Some studies on judgment and decision-making have demonstrated
      that uncertainty in probability influenced curvature of function given by judged
      probability or proportion (i.e., probability weighting function). In this study,
      we concentrated on proportion judgment about visual input. We investigated the
      possibility that the efficiency of feature detection of visual stimuli would be
      related to uncertainty in their proportion judgment. Concretely, our participants
      in the experiments performed proportion judgment task using two sets of visual
      stimuli pairs, "red vs. green dots" and "right vs. left tilted lines". In
      addition, we adopted different types of responses; in one condition, the
      participants were asked to response using numerals; in another condition, they
      were asked to response by adjusting the line bar which indicated the proportion.
      Our results suggested that the efficiency of feature detection of visual stimuli
      influenced the curvatures of the probability weighting function.</p>
