	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Language is a collaborative act: to successfully communicate,
      speakers must generate semantically valid utterances that are sensitive to the
      knowledge state of the listener. We asked whether parents&#8217; spatial
      descriptions are tuned to their children&#8217;s spatial knowledge. Parent-child
      pairs (n=16, m child age 4;1) viewed identical complex spatial arrays on separate
      computer screens. Parents were asked to describe target objects so that their
      child could identify them on their own screen. Children&#8217;s knowledge of
      left/right was independently tested using a comprehension task. A hierarchical
      statistical model of the experimentally elicited spatial language predicted that
      the probability of parents using left/right was greater for children that
      achieved higher comprehension scores, indicating successful communicative
      adaptation. This result did not hold for parents of children with severe spatial
      impairments (Williams Syndrome), suggesting that there is considerable variation
      in how well parents tune their language to their children&#8217;s level of
      spatial language and knowledge.</p>
