	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The Bridge dilemma (pushing a heavy man from a bridge in front of
      a train that would otherwise kill five persons) and the Switch dilemma
      (redirecting a train that would otherwise kill five persons onto another track
      where it kills one person) are presumably the two best-known moral dilemmas in
      philosophy and psychology. In this paper we claim that people&#8217;s intuitions
      about what to do in Bridge are robust, while intuitions about Switch can be
      influenced rather easily.  In doing so, we strongly disagree with Broeders and
      colleagues (2011) who recently argued for exactly the opposite claim. We discuss
      their interpretation of previous findings that were supposed to motivate their
      claim, present findings from previous studies that strongly support my claim, and
      report on failed attempts to replicate and present an experiment in which
      participants were willing to revise their judgment for Switch but not for Bridge.
