	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Individuals who continually track an object that suddenly vanishes
      indicate perceived vanishing points displaced beyond the actual vanishing point
      (i.e., forward displacement: FD) (Hubbard, 1995). Jordan, Coey, and Tsippaaoutis
      (2009 ) demonstrated that FD increases with implied friction (i.e., low to high
      friction) if one controls stimulus movements. Metcalfe and Greene (2007) showed
      that manipulations of stimulus control affected judgments of agency.  The present
      experiment examined the extent to which implied friction and conceptual factors
      (Reed & Vinson, 1996) affect feelings of agency during stimulus control. 
      Participants controlled the movements of a trapezoidal stimulus labeled as either
      a &#8220;bullet train&#8221; or a &#8220;house&#8221; in two levels of implied
      friction. Results revealed a marginally-significant increase in FD with implied
      friction. Agency also varied significantly between implied friction conditions,
      but only when participants conceptualized the stimulus as a bullet train and
      implied friction decreased across blocks (i.e., implied effort became
      optimal).</p>
