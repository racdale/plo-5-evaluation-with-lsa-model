	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The Stimulus Equivalence paradigm studies the learning of stimulus
      classes (categories) composed of functionally equivalent stimuli with or without
      perceptual similarities. The relations between stimuli in a class can either be
      learned or be derived from other stimulus relations: if stimulus A is equivalent
      to B, and B to C, then the equivalence between A and C can be derived without
      explicit training. There has been little work on the mechanisms underlying
      equivalence class formation. Here we present a neurobiologically plausible neural
      network model of stimulus class learning. The network successfully models three
      classic studies on stimulus equivalence.  The Hebbian weights in the model
      describe the formed equivalences and the levels of association between class
      members, and resulting activation patterns are correlated with the response
      accuracy and response latencies in the original studies. The model predicts that
      stimulus equivalence formation depends on the environmental regularities of
      stimuli occurrence and co-occurrence.</p>
