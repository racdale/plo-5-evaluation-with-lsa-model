	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We examined differences between the processing of inflectional
      versus derivational morphology in visual word recognition in Greek using masked
      and delayed priming. A lexical decision task to target verbs and nouns preceded
      by morphologically related primes of the same grammatical class was used to
      examine inflectional morphology, whereas the same target words preceded by primes
      of the other grammatical class were used to examine derivational morphology.
      Greek, a highly inflected language, allows use of words consisting of a stable
      stem and verb or noun inflectional suffixes, keeping the orthographic and
      phonological overlap constant across conditions. Both noun and verb targets were
      significantly primed by the same grammatical class, consistent with inflectional
      processing. When preceded by primes of different grammatical class, verb but not
      noun targets showed priming, precluding firm conclusions about derivational
      morphological processing.    </p>
