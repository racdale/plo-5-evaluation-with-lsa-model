	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We propose a modular neural-network structure for implementing the
      Bayesian framework for learning and inference. Our design has three main
      components, two for computing the priors and likelihoods based on observations
      and one for applying Bayes' rule. Through comprehensive simulations we show that
      our proposed model succeeds in implementing Bayesian learning and inference. We
      also provide a novel explanation of base-rate neglect, the most well-documented
      deviation from Bayes' rule, by modelling it as a weight decay mechanism which
      increases entropy. </p>
