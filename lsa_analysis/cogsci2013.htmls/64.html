	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The ability to recognize faces is arguably one of the most
      important and most practiced skills. The possible functions of the fusiform face
      area (FFA), generally believed to be responsible for face recognition, also
      feature these two characteristics. On the one hand, there are claims that the FFA
      has evolved into a face specific module due to great importance of face
      processing. On the other, the FFA is seen as a general visual expertise module
      that distinguishes between individual examples within a single category. The
      previous studies used experts and novices on stimuli such as cars, birds or
      butterflies with ambiguous results. Here this research stream is extended to the
      game of chess, which does not share visible features with faces. The first study
      shows that chess expertise modulates the FFA activation when complex multi-object
      chess positions were presented. In contrast, isolated single chess objects did
      not produce different activation patterns among experts and novices. The second
      study confirmed that even a couple of isolated objects do not differently engage
      the FFA among experts and novices. The two studies provide support for the
      general expertise view of the FFA function, but also extend the scope of our
      understanding about the function of the FFA. The FFA does not merely distinguish
      between different exemplars. It also seems to engage into parsing complex
      multi-object stimuli that contain numerous functional and spatial relations.</p>
