	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Self-explanation is an important constructive cognitive process
      that helps students learn in such a way that they can flexibly transfer their
      knowledge to solve novel problems (Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, & Glaser, 1989).
      However, research has not addressed what leads students to spontaneously
      self-explain, in the absence of prompting. The present study experimentally
      manipulates student motivation (in terms of achievement goals) and measures what
      influence this has on self-explanation and transfer. Participants (N = 140)
      received goal framings that reflected either a mastery-approach goal (striving to
      develop one&#8217;s understanding), a performance-approach goal (an aim to
      outperform others), a performance-avoidance goal (avoid doing worse than others)
      or a no-goal control. This framing was applied to a set of learning and test
      tasks on basic statistics, which participants completed while thinking aloud.
      Results showed a benefit for a performance-avoidance condition in terms of both
      higher levels of self-explanation and transfer. This unexpected result is
      discussed in terms of theories of motivation and learning, and their potential
      impact on educational practice. </p>
