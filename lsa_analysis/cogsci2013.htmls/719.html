	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Twenty-five children with developmental coordination disorder
      (DCD) and 25 age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) children were
      tested on writing-related visual motor tasks with a self-developed electronic
      assessment tools: &#8220;Writing Start&#8221;. Children with DCD were diagnosed
      according to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. TD children were recruited from
      community. Twenty figures with different complexities and sizes were used in the
      tasks. Error number, error time, and error pathway, each representing a deficit
      in action, temporal and spatial motor control of writing movement, were compared
      between groups. The error number was significantly larger in the DCD group than
      that in the TD group. The error time and error pathway were also longer in the
      DCD group than that in the TD group, especially when the figures were smaller and
      more complicated. Children with DCD indeed have difficulties in mastering visual
      motor skills for writing.</p>
