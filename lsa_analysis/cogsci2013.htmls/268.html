	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>By 8 months of age, infants use statistical regularities and
      perceptual cues to orient attention (e.g. Kirkham et al., 2007; Wu & Kirkham,
      2010). However, it is unclear whether infants are sensitive to the reliability of
      individual attentional cues. In this eye-tracking study, 8-month-olds were
      familiarized with a reliable face, which always looked to a box where an
      animation appeared, and an unreliable face, which looked only 25% of the time to
      the box containing the animation. At test, when the animations did not appear,
      infants searched longer in the corner cued by the reliable face, but did not
      search longer in the corner cued by the unreliable face. These results suggest
      that even young infants can track the the reliability of potential informants and
      use this information to distribute attention in support of early learning.</p>
