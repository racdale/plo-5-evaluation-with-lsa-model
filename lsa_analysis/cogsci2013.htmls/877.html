	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Participants were trained to perform a multitasking task involving
      prioritizing the sorting of a set of objects while frequently being interrupted
      by new objects to sort. After training, during an fMRI session, participants
      performed both the original task and a version of the task in which the function
      of a key part of the interface was modified. Analysis focused on the cognitive
      control network, a set of regions that decrease in activity with increasing
      levels of task experience. The functional connectivity of the anterior insula
      with the other regions of the control net work predicted the degree to which
      participants successfully adapted to this modified task better than other
      individual difference variables collected. The anterior insula is thought to be
      part of a salience network, and this salience network may help to inhibit old
      rules of the task set that must be replaced by new rules. </p>
