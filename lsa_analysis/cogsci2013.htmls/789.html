	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In a previous paper we showed that a set of representations, which
      we referred to as &#8220;atomic operational representations,&#8221; which are
      explicit spatiotemporal representations, can perform the function of grounding
      concepts of activities and interactions in the physical world. In this paper, to
      demonstrate how these operational representations can function in cognitive
      processes, we develop the basic ideas further by showing 1) how actions and their
      consequences can be observed and captured in operational representations; 2) how
      causal rules of actions can be learned and encoded in the form of operational
      representations through an unsupervised causal learning process; and 3) how the
      learned causal rules can be used in problem solving processes that produce
      desired action plans. We show that the same representations can be used across
      the various levels of cognitive processing in a unified manner. Experiments are
      proposed to test if the brain uses explicit temporal representations.</p>
