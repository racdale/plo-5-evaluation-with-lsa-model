	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Infants have expectations about physical properties of solid
      objects. However, evidence on infants&#8217; understanding of nonsolid substances
      (e.g., water or sand) is sparse and equivocal. We conducted four
      habituation/dishabituation experiments demonstrating that 5-month-olds have
      distinct expectations for how objects and substances behave. Experiment 1 found
      that infants use motion cues from the surface of a contained liquid or solid to
      predict whether it would pass
      through or rest on a grid when the container was upended. Experiment 2 extended
      these findings to show that motion cues led to different expectations about
      whether a new object will pass through or remain on the top surface of a liquid
      or solid. Experiments 3 and 4 replaced the liquid with sand. We found that
      infants expected sand, like liquid, to go through a grid, but did not expect
      another object to pass through it. These findings begin to characterize
      infants&#8217;
      understanding of substances.</p>
