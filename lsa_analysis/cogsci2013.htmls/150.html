	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper examines the impact of thinking-aloud (TA) instructions
      as well as of individuals' prior domain knowledge on information processing and
      source evaluation during Web search on a health-related topic. With regard to TA
      instructions, prompted instructions that entailed evaluation prompts (as used in
      some previous Web search studies) were compared to neutral instructions (in line
      with the standards defined by Ericsson & Simon, 1993) and to a silent condition.
      To measure participants' (N = 44) information processing and source evaluation we
      used a rich multi-method approach including eye-tracking methodologies, log file
      data, and verbal protocols. Results indicate that prompted TA instructions as
      compared to neutral instructions significantly increased participants' verbal
      reflections on information quality and on structural aspects of Web pages, given
      that participants possessed at least a moderate level of prior domain knowledge.
      In addition, prompted instructions resulted in less linear viewing sequences on
      the search engine results pages than the silent condition. Finally, the higher
      participants' prior domain knowledge the more intensely they scrutinized the
      search results presented by the search engine and the smaller were their average
      pupil sizes, which indicated lower cognitive load. The significance of the
      results is considered in light of methodological as well as educational
      implications.</p>
