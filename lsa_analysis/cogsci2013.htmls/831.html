	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Wayfinding difficulties in architecturally ambiguous environments
      can be overcome by orientating with given landmarks. However, it is not clear at
      which locations landmarks are most suitable to facilitate orientation. Our study
      addressed two questions: (1) Is subsequent wayfinding performance facilitated if
      participants freely place a number of landmark objects in a complex building? (2)
      Where do participants place the landmarks and which strategies guide effective
      landmark placement? First, participants were instructed to learn a number of goal
      locations in a virtual model of the Tate Gallery London. Then, participants in
      the experimental condition were instructed to place five unique landmarks in
      order to re-find the goals in a third phase; participants in a control condition
      could not place landmarks. Finally, participants were tested on their ability to
      find the goals again, with time and distance as main dependent variables. Results
      are discussed with respect to placement strategies and environmental
      properties.</p>
