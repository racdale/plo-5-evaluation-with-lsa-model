	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Early in acquisition children overgeneralize verbs to
      ungrammatical structures.  The retreat from overgeneralization is linked to the
      acquisition of verb classes, the semantics of which constrain the structures in
      which a verb can appear (e.g., Pinker 1989; Ambridge, Pine & Rowland, 2012). How
      children learn these classes remains unclear.  Some argue that distributional
      regularities in linguistic input provide sufficient evidence for verb classes to
      emerge and become linked to particular structures.  A corpus analysis of the
      English locative construction (e.g., the woman sprayed water onto the wall/the
      wall with water) demonstrated that children have similar verb classes to adults.
      A correspondence analysis revealed that distributional regularities in the input
      could support these verb classes.  Finally, a connectionist simulation was able
      to model early overgeneralization and retreat through distributional learning of
      verb classes.  These results support a distributional learning account of verb
      semantics.</p>
