	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The current study examines the generalization of the Category
      Adjustment Model (CAM) across scales along two dimensions: time and distance.
      Participants were presented with geologic time and astronomical distance
      information either conventionally or using the hierarchical alignment model.
      Participants provided with hierarchically structured magnitude information for
      time and distances were more accurate on similar estimations at large scales than
      participants given the same content in a conventional manner. Patterns in event
      and distance estimation, along with overall group differences, are consistent
      with the CAM; suggesting people use hierarchically organized categorical
      information when estimating across scales and dimensions, and providing salient
      category boundary information improves estimation. Findings suggest a common
      representation of scale information for temporal, spatial, and abstract (numeric)
      magnitudes. Patterns of abstract magnitude estimations are consistent with
      segmented linear models of scale representation. Implications of the CAM in scale
      representation and the hierarchical alignment model in education are
      discussed.</p>
