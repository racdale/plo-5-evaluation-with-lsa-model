	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>During mind wandering, attention is directed away from the
      external environment and cognitive processing is decoupled. Mind wandering is
      usually treated as a dichotomy and often measured using self-reports. We here
      propose the levels-of-inattention hypothesis, postulating graded decoupling at
      different processing levels. To measure levels of decoupling during reading we
      introduce the sustained attention to stimulus task (SAST), which relies on
      psychophysics of error detection. We found that subjects were less likely to
      notice errors at higher levels of cognitive processing. Eye tracking showed that
      before errors were overlooked effects of high- and low-level linguistic variables
      were reduced in a graded fashion, indicating episodes of weak and deep
      decoupling. Individual gaze durations predicted overlooking of errors five
      seconds before they occurred. Our findings support the levels-of-inattention
      hypothesis and suggest levels of mind wandering can be measured in the SAST. Eye
      tracking provides a promising tool to detect mind wandering online. </p>
