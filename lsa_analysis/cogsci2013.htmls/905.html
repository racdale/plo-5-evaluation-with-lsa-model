	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The cognitive mechanisms that underlie beliefs in the supernatural
      are not well
      understood. In an attempt to understand this phenomenon, we hypothesized that the
      cave
      environment &#8220;affords&#8221; such usage. In our experiment, 52 participants
      completed a survey
      about their metaphysical beliefs inside a room providing a great deal of natural
      light,
      while another 52 participants completed the same survey in a dark and windowless
      room.
      The survey asked participants to rate their beliefs in a variety of supernatural
      phenomena
      and also included multiple-choice questions which described bizarre scenarios
      that could
      be explained either scientifically or supernaturally. The supernatural responses
      to both
      the rating-scale questions and to the multiple-choice questions were
      significantly higher
      in the cave-like condition. These results are consistent with anthropological
      claims
      that the dark zones of caves may have played a role in the environment of
      evolutionary
      adaptedness that contributed to humans&#8217; tendency toward magical
      thinking.</p>
