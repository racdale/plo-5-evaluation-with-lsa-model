	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This paper demonstrates a new quantitative approach to identify
      what is behind universally sensed sound symbolism and sound symbolism detected
      only by speakers of a particular language. We presented 70 locomotion videos to
      Japanese and English speakers and asked them to create a word that would
      sound-symbolically match each action, then to rate the action on five semantic
      dimensions. Multivariate analyses revealed that certain sound-meaning links
      (e.g., voicing and speed) were more consistent than others within and across
      languages. Language-specific sound symbolism was also found for some
      sound-meaning links (e.g., the affricate manner of articulation was associated
      with light motions in Japanese, but with heavy motions in English). This implies
      that cross-linguistically shared and language-specific parts of sound symbolism
      are intricately intertwined within each language. This research underscores the
      importance of a bottom-up approach which can exploratorily investigate the
      complex sound-symbolic systems as a whole.</p>
