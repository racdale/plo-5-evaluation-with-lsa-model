	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent evidence suggests that we have an intuitive number sense
      and that visuospatial processes may ground simple mathematical reasoning, but
      higher level mathematical cognition is often assumed to depend only on the
      manipulation of symbolic expressions, governed by a set of rules and logical
      axioms. To assess rule vs. visuospatial thinking in a higher level mathematical
      domain, we asked undergraduates to solve trigonometry problems and to report
      their use of rules, mnemonics, and visuospatial representations including the
      unit circle, right triangle, and sine and cosine waves. Use of the unit circle
      was reported most commonly, and was associated with better performance, even
      after controlling for the extent and recency of trigonometry experience. While
      unit circle users took more time, their performance was robust to problems that
      rule users tended to fail. Our findings suggest that even higher level
      mathematical cognition is more than just the manipulation of symbolic
      expressions.</p>
