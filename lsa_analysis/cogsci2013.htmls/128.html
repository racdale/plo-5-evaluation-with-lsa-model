	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Making accurate judgments is an essential skill in everyday life.
      However, little is known about the basic cognitive skills required for accurate
      judgments. Research on judgment and categorization processes suggests that people
      rely on various strategies when making judgments. These strategies differ in the
      cognitive abilities they require. Specifically high working memory capacity may
      benefit rule-based judgments, whereas good long-term memory may be crucial for
      memory-based judgments. We investigated this hypothesis following an individual
      differences approach. 177 participants performed two judgment tasks that were
      either best solved by a rule-based or a memory-based strategy. Additionally, we
      measured working memory capacity and episodic memory with three tests. Consistent
      with our hypothesis structural equation modeling showed that working memory
      capacity predicted judgment accuracy in the rule-based task whereas episodic
      memory predicted judgment accuracy in the memory-based task. Apparently,
      different memory abilities are essential for successfully adopting different
      judgment strategies.</p>
