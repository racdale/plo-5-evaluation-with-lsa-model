	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent work has started to ask to what degree common ground, i.e.
      shared background knowledge, may affect the articulation of co-speech gestures,
      specifically as regards viewpoint. We extend that work by asking how gesture
      articulation is affected, and how the spatial location of those gestures changes
      as a result of common ground. Using naturalistic data, we find that with quotes
      grounded in past interactions, co-speech gestures are fewer and smaller, whereas
      with quotes ungrounded in past interactions (UGPI), co-speech gestures are more
      numerous and larger. Moreover, when speakers repeatedly reference the same
      entity, the co-speech gestures used become smaller with each repeated reference,
      thereby suggesting a kind of &#8216;online&#8217; grounding. We also find that
      the use of gestural space is more consistent for UGPI utterances. This suggests
      that common ground affects both the articulation of gestures, and the way that
      gesture space is used.</p>
