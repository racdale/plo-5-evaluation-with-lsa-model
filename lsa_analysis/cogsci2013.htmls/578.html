	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Proper name systems provide individuals with personal identifiers,
      and convey social and hereditary information. We identify a common information
      structure in the name grammars of the world&#8217;s languages, which makes this
      complex information processing task manageable, and evaluate the impact that the
      re-engineering of naming practices for legal and political purposes has had on
      the communicative and psychological properties of these socially evolved systems.
      While East-Asian naming systems have been largely unaffected by state
      legislation, legal interference has transformed Western naming practices, making
      individual names harder to process and remember. Further, the structural collapse
      of Western naming systems has not affected all parts of society equally: In the
      US, it has had a disproportionate impact on those sections of society that are
      least successful in economic and social terms. We consider the implications of
      these changes for name memory across the lifespan, and for future naming
      practices.</p>
