	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many previous studies showed that the causal information
      externally given (hereafter external information) did not succeed in changing the
      causal structure driven from the covariation data when the external information
      and the covariation data were in conflict. We speculated that the salience of the
      external information is crucial in causal inference. The external information did
      not affect the causal inference when the external information and the covariation
      data were simultaneously presented in Experiment 1. However, when the external
      information and the covariation data were sequentially presented and participants
      were asked to report the causal structure and the strength each time in
      Experiments 2 and 3, participants were more likely to report the causal structure
      of the external information when the covariation data were drawn from a different
      causal structure. Results of the three experiments showed that the external
      information can override the covariation data under certain conditions.</p>
