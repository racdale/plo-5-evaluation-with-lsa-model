	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Linguistic features can predict several aspects of human behavior.
      Little is known, however, about whether syntactic, semantic and structural
      language features can also predict psychological disorders such as posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD). The current study investigated whether the linguistic
      properties in trauma narratives written by survivors of a Motor Vehicle Accident
      (MVA), change as function of the intensity of PTSD symptoms. A short form
      diagnostic tool known as the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) was
      used to determine the severity of participant PTSD symptomatology. Using a text
      capture paradigm participants were then asked to write a neutral narrative or a
      narrative that described their traumatic event. PCL scores were compared to
      linguistic variables from eight different computational linguistic algorithms.
      Results from this study suggested that the relative intensity of PTSD
      symptomatology affects syntactic, semantic, and structural aspects of the
      narrative.</p>
