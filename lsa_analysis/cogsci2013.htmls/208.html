	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Making inference in everyday life often requires people to make
      inferences about low frequency events. In the most extreme case, some types of
      object or event may have never been previously observed. An experiment is
      presented in which participants needed to infer the existence and number of
      unobserved event types, based solely on the frequency distribution of a set of
      observed events. Results indicate people's inferences are sensitive to the shape
      of the distribution over the observed events, even when the number of observed
      events and event types is held constant, and that people are able to infer
      abstract rules that describe entire classes of event distributions. Human
      inferences are shown to be similar to those made by a hierarchical Bayesian
      model.</p>
