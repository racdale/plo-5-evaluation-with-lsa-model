	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Although Bilingual First Language Acquisition research has
      increased considerably over the past few decades, there is still much controversy
      regarding the rate of development, i.e. the question whether bilinguals lag
      behind their monolingual peers in various aspects of language. Some studies have
      found similar rates of development, whereas others have found that bilingual
      children lag behind their monolingual peers. The current study contributes to
      this discussion of (dis)similar rates of development by investigating bilingual
      children&#8217;s acquisition of German complex sentence constructions involving
      adverbial clauses (ACs). Our findings are consistent with usage-based approaches
      to language acquisition, which predict that bilingual acquisition should proceed
      slower due to learners having less exposure, on average, to each language.</p>
