	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated motor resonance effect(MRE) during perceiving
      interactive social action scenes of two people. Perspectives of the social action
      scenes were manipulated by the voice (active vs. passive) of sentences describing
      the scenes. In Exp1, subjects' response time for stepping on a pedal was analyzed
      for investigating MRE during understanding of the scenes where a person is
      stepping on a foot of the other person. In Exp2, the response time by the lip
      action on a microphone were analyzed for exploring MRE during perceiving of the
      scenes where a person is biting an arm of the other person. In results, the MRE
      in both experiments was significant only when the scenes were described in the
      active voice. Our results indicate that the motor resonance effect can occur
      during perception of social events, but it can be modulated by the perspective of
      the mental construal of the event.</p>
