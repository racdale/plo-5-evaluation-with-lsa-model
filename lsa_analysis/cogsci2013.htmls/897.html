	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In face-to-face communication people have problems recalling which
      facts they have disclosed to whom. We explore if such destination memory (DM)
      problems also exist in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Participants (N =
      64) disclosed 50 pieces of personal information to 50 fictitious partners in a
      sham Skype environment in two conditions, one-sided &#8220;telling&#8221; and
      communicative &#8220;turn-taking&#8221;. Their recall for facts, faces, and
      fact-face-pairs was measured as dependent variables. ANOVA results show a
      significant main effect of type of recall (F (2,61) = 222.47, p &lt; .001):
      recall for facts was better than for faces or fact-face-pairs, indicating that DM
      problems emerge when faces are previously unknown. Additionally, we found a
      significant main effect of conditions (F (1,62) = 6.75, p = .012): contrary to
      expectations recall in the &#8220;telling&#8221; condition was best. These
      interesting findings and those of a second study will be discussed considering
      the specific characteristics of CMC.</p>
