	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The excellent temporal resolution of event-related potentials
      (ERPs) makes it an ideal technique to test the timing of events within cognitive
      models which may not be distinguishable using behavioural data. Here a model of
      an ERP component is presented which tests features of the ACT-R cognitive
      architecture. The P300 is an event-related potential that is associated with
      attending to incoming stimuli and subsequent memory processing. It is commonly
      elicited using an oddball task in which a series of stimuli are presented
      comprising infrequent target stimuli against a background of frequent standard
      stimuli. It is influenced by the probability of a target in a sequence of
      stimuli. An ACT-R model was developed of the oddball task. P300 amplitude was
      correlated with the activation of the memory of the target stimuli, providing a
      good account of the component. The implications of these findings for the ACT-R
      architecture are discussed.</p>
