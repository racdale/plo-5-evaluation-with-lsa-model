	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the process of embodied
      cognition in distance estimation. According to recent cognitive science studies,
      our intelligent behavior that ranges from perception to inference is not
      accomplished in only a closed mental process, but is affected by body and action.
      However, previous studies do not clarify whether these effects were derived from
      physical load or subjective heaviness. In order to examine the question, two
      experiments were conducted using the &#8220;size-weight illusion&#8217;&#8217;.
      Performance on the distance estimation task was not affected by subjective
      heaviness but by physical load.</p>
