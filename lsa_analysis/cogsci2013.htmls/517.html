	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Neural correlate of human inductive reasoning process is still
      unclear. Number series and letter series completion are two typical inductive
      reasoning tasks, and with common core component of rule induction. Previous
      studies have demonstrated that different strategies are adopted in number series
      and letter series completion tasks even the underlying rules are identical. In
      the present study, we examined cortical activation as a function of two different
      reasoning strategies for solving series completion tasks. The retrieval strategy,
      used in number series completion tasks, involves direct retrieving of arithmetic
      knowledge to get the relations between items. The procedural strategy, used in
      letter series completion tasks, requires counting a certain number of times to
      detect the relations linking two items. The two strategies require essentially
      the equivalent cognitive processes, but have different working memory demands
      (the procedural strategy incurs greater demands). The procedural strategy
      produced significant greater activity in areas involved in memory retrieval
      (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and mental representation/maintenance
      (posterior parietal cortex, PPC). An ACT-R model of the tasks successfully
      predicted behavioral performance and BOLD responses in DLPFC and PPC. The present
      findings support a general-purpose dual-process theory of inductive reasoning
      regarding the cognitive architecture.</p>
