	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In this study, the relationship between prior recall and
      recognition and its effects on false memory was investigated using low and high
      confusable phonological associates. Participants who had falsely recalled
      critical words in an earlier phase were less likely to falsely recognize them
      later. This pattern of results is in contrast with veridical memory, where
      participants were more likely to recognize a word after correctly recalling it
      earlier. We further investigated this phenomenon with the remember-know paradigm,
      and found that recognition of prior recalled words was associated with more
      remember responses while recognition of falsely recalled critical words was
      associated with more know responses. These findings suggest that the underlying
      processes for veridical and false recognition may each involve different aspects
      of recollection and familiarity for phonological associates.</p>
