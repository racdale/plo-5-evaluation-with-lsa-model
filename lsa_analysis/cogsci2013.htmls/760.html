	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When building a lexicon, young children must first learn
      individual word-object mappings and subsequently extend these mappings to new
      category instances. Recent methodological advances demonstrate that processing
      efficiency during the initial mapping process increases between 15 and 24
      months-of-age. The current study investigates real-time processing during the
      second word learning step, generalization. Using a head-mounted eye-tracker,
      18-month old children completed a novel noun generalization task with novel solid
      objects. Many participants generalized names for solid objects based on
      similarity in shape rather than similarity in material. The addition of
      eye-tracking data in the current study reveals children&#8217;s comparison of
      test and exemplar objects both before and after novel name presentation.
      Integrating eye-tracking data with measures of vocabulary knowledge can elucidate
      how vocabulary organization speeds the generalization decision. Future work will
      manipulate syntactic context to examine how children&#8217;s knowledge of count
      and mass nouns further influences the generalization decision process.</p>
