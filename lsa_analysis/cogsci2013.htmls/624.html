	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study aims to develop a Japanese version of the remote
      associates test required to decompose semantic chunks for use not only in
      behavioral studies but also in brain researches. Further, this study attempted to
      reveal the relationship between the process of solving insight problems and brain
      activities. Results of the behavioral data show that the solution time was
      significantly longer in the chunked than in the non-chunked condition. The
      imaging data identified the following brain activities. First, the right and left
      cingulate gyri, related to conflict monitoring, were more activated during the
      process of searching for a target in the chunked than in the non-chunked
      condition. Second, the left posterior cingulate gyrus was more activated when the
      participants could find a target by overcoming constraints as semantic chunks
      related to emotional process.</p>
