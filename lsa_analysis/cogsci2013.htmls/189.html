	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The paper presents two studies that investigated how individuals
      reason from disjunctive statements that use numerical estimations. In the
      experiments two types of such statements were used. In the first type both
      constituents of a disjunction could be a logically correct answer. That is, if
      &#8220;The average life time of a fruit fly is either 9 or 27 days&#8221;, any of
      those numbers is logically possible. In the second type that truth of one
      constituent excluded the truth of the other, e.g. &#8220;The average time of
      holidays in the EU is either higher than 9 days or else higher than 27
      days&#8221;. A simple repetition of any of those figures is an illusory inference
      as it renders both constituents true. The results of Experiment 1 proved that
      although the participants showed a tendency to repeat one of the disjuncts as
      their answer, this tendency was smaller when the content of the statements
      referred to politics and social life in comparison with the general knowledge
      questions. The results of Experiment 2 showed that individuals reveal the
      tendency to repeat opinions coming from speakers who are more likeable, even if
      such opinions are incorrect illusory inferences. The results of both studies show
      that illusory inferences appear also in the domain of numerical cognition but
      they may be reduced by pragmatic factors such as the content of the message and
      the knowledge about its source.</p>
