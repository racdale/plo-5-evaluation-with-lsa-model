	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Affect is important in motivated performance situations such as
      negotiation. Longstanding theories of emotion suggest that facial expressions
      provide enough information to perceive another person&#8217;s internal affective
      state. Alternatively, the contextual emotion hypothesis posits that situational
      factors bias the perception of emotion in others&#8217; facial displays. This
      hypothesis predicts that individuals will have different perceptions of the same
      facial expression depending upon the context in which the expression is
      displayed. In this study, cardiovascular indexes of motivational states (i.e.,
      challenge vs. threat) were recorded while players engaged in a multi-issue
      negotiation where the opposing negotiator (confederate) displayed emotional
      facial expressions (angry vs. happy); the confederate&#8217;s negotiation
      strategy (cooperative vs. competitive) was factorially crossed with his facial
      expression. During the game, participants&#8217; eye fixations and cardiovascular
      responses, indexing task engagement and challenge/threat motivation, were
      recorded. Results indicated that participants playing confederates with
      incongruent facial expressions (e.g., cooperative strategy, angry face) exhibited
      a greater threat response, which arises due to increased uncertainty. Eye
      fixations also suggest that participants look at the face more in order to
      acquire information to reconcile their uncertainty in the incongruent condition.
      Taken together, these results suggest that context matters in the perception of
      emotion.</p>
