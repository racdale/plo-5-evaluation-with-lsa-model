	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In everyday communication, people not only use speech but also
      hand gestures to convey information. One intriguing question in gesture research
      has been why gestures take the specific form they do. Previous research has
      identified the speaker-gesturer&#8217;s communicative intent as one factor
      shaping the form of iconic gestures. Here we investigate whether communicative
      intent also shapes the form of pointing gestures. In an experimental setting,
      twenty-four participants produced pointing gestures identifying a referent for an
      addressee. The communicative intent of the speaker-gesturer was manipulated by
      varying the informativeness of the pointing gesture. A second independent
      variable was the presence or absence of concurrent speech. As a function of their
      communicative intent and irrespective of the presence of speech, participants
      varied the durations of the stroke and the post-stroke hold-phase of their
      gesture. These findings add to our understanding of how the communicative context
      influences the form that a gesture takes. </p>
