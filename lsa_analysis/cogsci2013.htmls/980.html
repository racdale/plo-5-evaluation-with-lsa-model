	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Structure Mapping Theory (SMT) is an important and influential
      theory in
      cognitive science. One unresolved issue is this theory's intractability. It
      is known that finding optimally systematic analogies under SMT is NP-hard,
      making it unrealistic that human analogizing is characterized by
      optimality. Yet, experimental studies suggest that the optimality assumption
      gives the best fit to human performance data. A solution to this paradox may
      be that SMT can be efficiently approximated to such a degree that, for
      practical intents and purposes, human analogies appear to be optimal.
      However, outside of a limited empirical evaluation of the commonly-used
      greedy SME heuristic given in Forbus and Oblinger (1990), no analyses of the 
      approximability of SMT have been done to date. We fill this void by
      providing both the first theoretical analyses of the types of efficient
      approximability available for SMT and the first systematic empirical
      evaluation of the greedy SME heuristic.</p>
