	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The two-system hypothesis states that there are two kinds of
      reasoning systems, the first of which is evolutionarily old, heuristically (or
      associatively) based, automatic, fast, and is a collection of independent
      systems. The second is evolutionarily new, perhaps peculiar to humans, is
      rule-based, controlled, slow, and is a single token system. Advocates of the
      two-system hypothesis generally support their claim by an inference to the best
      explanation: two systems are needed to explain experimental data from the
      reasoning, heuristics, and biases literature. The best evidence for this claim
      comes from simultaneous contradictory belief (henceforth SCB) (Sloman 1996,
      2002). I argue that Sloman has not provided us with cases of SCB. In each of his
      examples there is no evidence that the beliefs are held simultaneously. I then
      offer the outline for an experimental setup that would offer compelling evidence
      for the existence of SCB and thereby support the two-system hypothesis.</p>
