	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We investigated the use of iconic and deictic gestures during the
      communication of spatial information. Expert structural geologists were asked to
      explain one portion of a geologic map. Spatial gestures used in each
      expert&#8217;s response were coded as deictic (indicating an object in the
      conversational space), iconic (depicting an aspect of an object or event), or
      both deictic and iconic (indicating an object in the conversational space by
      depicting an aspect of that object). Speech paired with each gesture was coded
      for whether or not it referred to complex spatial properties (e.g. shape and
      orientation of an object). Results indicated that when communicating spatial
      information, people occasionally use gestures that are both deictic and iconic,
      and that these gestures tend to occur when complex spatial information is not
      provided in speech. These results suggest that existing classifications of
      gesture are not exclusive, especially for spatial discourse. </p>
