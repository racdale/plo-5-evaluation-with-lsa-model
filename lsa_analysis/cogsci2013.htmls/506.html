	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The present study examined how time-on-task (i.e., practice and
      fatigue) influences eye movements during visual search. First, we examined how
      practice influences eye movements during an extended visual search task. Results
      replicate the findings that over the course of a visual search task, performance
      improves and fixation duration increases. Yet changes in fixation duration did
      not correlate with changes in search performance. Next, we examined how fatigue
      influences eye movements during an extended visual search task. To manipulate
      fatigue, participants either did or did not receive breaks. Those who did not
      receive breaks replicated our initial findings. Critically, participants who did
      receive breaks showed no increase in fixation duration over the course of the
      visual search task. These results indicate that the increase in fixation duration
      with time-on-task reflects fatigue, and that this measure of fatigue can be
      derived independent of measures of performance improvements, such as shorter
      response times</p>
