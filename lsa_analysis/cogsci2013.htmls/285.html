	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How do people coordinate actions with others? We tested the
      hypothesis that pairs of participants strategically reduce the variability of
      their action performance to achieve synchronicity in the absence of visual
      feedback about each other&#8217;s actions. Consistent with this prediction,
      participants moved faster and less variably in a condition where they could not
      see their task partner&#8217;s movements compared to a condition in which visual
      information was available. The accuracy of the resulting coordination was the
      same in both conditions. These findings are interpreted as evidence for general
      strategic adaptation in the service of real-time action coordination when only
      minimal perceptual information is available. </p>
