	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Recent evidence suggests that lexical-semantic activation spread,
      including the formation of ad-hoc relations, can be dynamically shaped by
      contextual factors (Abdel Rahman & Melinger, 2011). In this study we investigated
      whether cognitive processing modes can affect lexical-semantic activation during
      single word production. Specifically, we tested whether prior processing of
      linguistic ambiguities, presented in the form of puns, has an influence on the
      co-activation of unrelated meanings of homophones in a subsequent language
      production task. In a picture-word interference paradigm with word distractors
      that were semantically related or unrelated to the non-depicted meanings of
      homophones we found facilitation induced by related words only when participants
      listened to puns before object naming, but not when they heard jokes with
      unambiguous linguistic stimuli. This finding suggests that a cognitive mode of
      ambiguity processing can induce the activation of ambiguous messages during
      speech planning. </p>
