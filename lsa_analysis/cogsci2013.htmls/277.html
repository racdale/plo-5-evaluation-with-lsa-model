	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous work suggests that inductive and deductive reasoning may
      be accomplished by different processes. Here, we examine whether different
      phenomena of inductive reasoning, previously explained in the same way, may rely
      on different types of processes. In Experiment 1 we show that trials which
      examine sensitivity to sample size in inductive reasoning have greater effects on
      secondary task performance than do trials examining sensitivity to the diversity
      of the sample. In Experiment 2 we show that in a surprise recognition memory
      test, participants have significantly better memory for the content of diversity
      trials than for sample size trials. Both findings are consistent with the
      suggestion that some phenomena of inductive reasoning may be rule-based, whereas
      others may depend on feature-level processing.</p>
