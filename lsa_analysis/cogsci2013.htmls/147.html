	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Many studies have examined the distinction between feature-and
      relation-based categories (Gentner, 2005; Genter & Kurtz, 2005; Jung & Hummel,
      2009; Tomlinson & Love, 2011). Those findings suggest that featural and relationl
      categories have fundamentally different learning algorithms, where relational
      categories rely on explicit representations and thus require working memory and
      attention, as opposed to featural categories which may be learned more
      implicitly. In this study, we investigated further the distinction between
      feature-and relation-based category learning using a dual task methodology. Our
      results revealed an interaction: featural category learning was more impaired by
      a visuospatial dual task than by a verbal dual task, whereas relational category
      learning was more impaired by the verbal dual task. Our results suggest that in
      contrast to featural category learning, which may involve mainly non-verbal
      mechanisms, relational category learning appears to place greater demands on more
      explicit and attention-demanding verbal or verbally-related learning
      mechanisms.</p>
