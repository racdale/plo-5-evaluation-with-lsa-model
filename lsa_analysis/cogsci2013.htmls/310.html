	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Vertical and horizontal head movements (universally associated
      with nodding and shaking, respectively) have frequently been demonstrated to
      affect cognitive processes. Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis
      that overt head movements can influence memory for valenced images. In the first
      experiment, participants were instructed to perform either vertical or horizontal
      head movements while viewing a slideshow of 76 randomized positive and negative
      images, which they later had to recognize from a set containing 50% of the same
      target images and 50% distractor images. No interaction between head movement
      type and image valence was obtained. In the second experiment, participants were
      told to remember as many images as possible from a slideshow of 60 randomized
      valenced images, which they were later asked to freely recall. A significant
      interaction was obtained, with a higher rate of recall for positive images when
      vertical head movements (VHM) were performed and a higher rate of recall for
      negative images when horizontal head movements (HHM) were performed.</p>
