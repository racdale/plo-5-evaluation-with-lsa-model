	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When a visual object is briefly flashed, it appears to lag behind
      another moving object (flash-lag effect; FLE). Previous studies show that a
      sudden change to the moving object at the time of the flash presentation can
      eliminate the FLE. We examined whether the FLE is eliminated when a moving object
      alternates in color as it moves. Observers viewed a moving disc, the color of
      which did not change at all, changed only once when another object flashed, or
      alternated between two colors as it moved before the flash presentation. The
      results showed that although the magnitude of the FLE was reduced compared with
      the no-change condition, the FLE observed with the moving object that changed
      color during motion was significantly stronger than the FLE in the one-change
      condition. The results are discussed in relation to the object updating account
      of the FLE.</p>
