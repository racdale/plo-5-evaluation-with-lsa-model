	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In order to better understand how humans acquire knowledge, one of
      the essential goals in cognitive science is to build a cognitive model of human
      learning. However, manual construction of such cognitive models is time
      consuming, and requires domain expertise. Further, manually-constructed models
      may still miss distinctions in learning which are important for instruction in
      education. Our prior work proposed an approach that finds cognitive models using
      a state-of-the-art learning agent, SimStudent, and we demonstrated that, for
      algebra learning, the agent can find a better cognitive model than human experts.
      To ensure the generality of that proposed approach, we further apply it to three
      domains: algebra, stoichiometry, and fraction addition. To evaluate the quality
      of the cognitive models discovered, we measured how well the cognitive models fit
      to student learning curve data. SimStudent discovers cognitive models that
      predicts human student behavior better than the human-generated models.</p>
