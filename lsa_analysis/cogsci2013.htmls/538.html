	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The phenomenon of insight is frequently characterized by the
      experience of a sudden and certain solution. Anecdotal accounts suggest insight
      frequently occurs after the problem solver has taken some time away from the
      problem (i.e., incubation).  Here we used Compound Remote Associates problems to
      examine how incubation affects the subjective experience of insight at different
      levels of problem fixation.  We hypothesized that incubation would elicit a
      mind-set change resulting in improved problem solving performance regardless of
      the initial level of fixation. Second, we predicted to the extent that insight
      reflects a person&#8217;s assessment of mind-set change, the experience of
      insight would be more likely after incubation. Results were consistent with these
      predictions. These findings suggest that the role of incubation in producing
      insight may have more to do with changing mind-set than forgetting information
      that fixates problem solvers.</p>
