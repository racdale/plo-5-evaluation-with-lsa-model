	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A robust empirical regularity in decision making is that the
      negative consequences of an option (i.e., losses) often have a stronger impact on
      people&#8217;s behavior than the positive consequences (i.e., gains). One common
      explanation for such a gain-loss asymmetry is loss aversion. To model loss
      aversion in risky decisions, prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) assumes a
      kinked value function (which translates objective consequences into subjective
      utilities), with a steeper curvature for losses than for gains. We highlight,
      however, that the prospect theory framework offers many alternative ways to model
      gain-loss asymmetries (e.g., via the weighting function, which translates
      objective probabilities into subjective decision weights; or via the choice
      rule). Our goal is to systematically test these alternative models against each
      other. In a reanalysis of data by Gl&#246;ckner and Pachur (2012), we show that
      people&#8217;s risky decisions are best accounted for by a version of prospect
      theory that has a more elevated weighting function for losses than for gains but
      the same value function for both domains. These results contradict the common
      assumption that a kinked value function is necessary to model risky choices and
      point to the neglected role of people&#8217;s differential probability weighting
      in the gain and loss domains.</p>
