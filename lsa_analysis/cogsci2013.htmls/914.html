	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The metaphor of cognition as a dynamical system - which evolves
      under external forces, is constrained by the internal structure, and is shaped by
      the agent's behavioral history - is a fruitful source of inspiration guiding
      experimental and theoretical work. Dynamic Field Theory offers a framework, in
      which cognitive processes and their development may be modeled quantitatively as
      dynamics of activation functions defined over behaviorally-relevant parameter
      spaces. Although learning through memory trace formation is an integral part of
      the DFT, the behavioral spaces are assumed to be given. However, these spaces may
      be shaped autonomously while acting in an environment. The autonomy of learning
      processes is achieved if the behavioral states have intentional structure, which
      sustains representations to enable learning and ensures their deactivation when
      appropriate. In this work, I show how intentional structure realized with Dynamic
      Neural Fields enables autonomous development of a sensorimotor mapping involved
      in looking behavior.</p>
