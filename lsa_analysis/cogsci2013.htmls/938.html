	<h1>Eye motion along a static concrete object: Why &#8220;fictive motion&#8221; is not a figurative mental phenomenon</h1>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Fictive motion (specifically the co-extension path type:
      &#8220;The road runs through the desert&#8221;) is widely considered a specific
      class of figurative language. However, cognitive-linguistic and
      conceptual-metaphoric evidence is presented which suggests that linguistically
      expressed motion in fictive motion implicitly refers to the processing of a
      concrete action: to eye motion that occurs while scanning along a static visual
      percept (or mental image). As such, fictive motion differs principally from
      genuinely figurative expressions like ARGUMENT IS WAR &#8211; the figurative
      element of the latter cannot be interpreted as referring directly to a physically
      existing action or object. Also demonstrated is how a
      &#8220;non-figurative&#8221; theoretical approach to fictive motion can explain
      and predict so-called &#8220;non-fictive motion&#8221;; fictive motion-like
      temporal cognition; and fictive-motion types other than co-extension path. It is
      also shown how the various experimental cognitive and neurocognitive findings on
      fictive motion can be (re)interpreted in the new framework.</p>
