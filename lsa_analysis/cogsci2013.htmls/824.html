	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In order to study the formation of symbol communication systems,
      we conducted an experiment based on a game introduced by Galantucci (2005). This
      involved pairwise communication in which the pairs engaged in a coordination task
      through an exchange of messages composed of a small set of geometric figures. We
      analyzed the transfer entropy&#8212;which is a measure of the information flow
      between two information sources or stochastic processes&#8212;between the figures
      used and the actions by individuals. Consequently, we confirmed that the transfer
      entropy reduced significantly across individuals, but not within each individual.
      Moreover, it correlated negatively with the performance of the task. From these
      results, we suggest that the transfer entropy appropriately shows the degree of
      formation of symbol communication systems. Then, we report the causal
      relationship between the uncertainty and the performances using a computational
      model based on reinforcement learning.</p>
