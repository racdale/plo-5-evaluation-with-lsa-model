	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In sentence processing, retrieval cue parsing accounts predict
      that processing difficulty occurs due to interference between similar noun
      phrases at verb integration (Van Dyke & Lewis, 2003; Van Dyke, 2007). An
      important factor is number marking of the nouns because the number of the verb
      and the subject has to agree. According to Lewis and Vasishth (2005), different
      types of retrieval cue overlap (e.g., verb subcategorisation, semantics, number)
      should all cause interference simultaneously during processing. However, Van Dyke
      (2007) reported that interference due to subcategorisation overlap preceded
      semantic interference, suggesting that syntactic interference may occur before
      interference due to other cues. We investigated whether interference due to
      number overlap also occurs later than interference due to subcategorisation
      overlap. Interestingly, using eye-tracking, we found that the number congruency
      effect occurred early and no later than the subcategorisation interference
      effect, indicating that number interference has a very rapid effect on sentence
      processing.</p>
