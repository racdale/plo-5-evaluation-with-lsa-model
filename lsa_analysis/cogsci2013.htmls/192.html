	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A social Simon effect exists when two individuals perform a
      Go/No-Go task in the presence of each other, but not when they perform the same
      task alone. Such effects are argued to indicate that individuals co-represent
      task goals and the to-be-performed actions of a co-actor. The present study
      investigates an alternative hypothesis&#8212;that these effects are due to
      dynamical entrainment processes that couple the behavior of socially situated
      actors. Participants performed a standard Go/No-Go Simon task in joint and
      individual conditions. The dynamic structure of response times (RTs) was examined
      using nonlinear methods. Consistent with our hypothesis, the analyses revealed
      that the structure of RTs in the joint condition indicate interpersonal coupling
      constraining participant behavior and were more correlated across a range of
      time-scales compared to the RTs of pseudo-pair controls. The findings imply that
      dynamic processes might underlie social stimulus-response compatibility effects
      and shape joint cognitive processes in general.</p>
