	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>According to decades of research in affective neuroscience, the
      left and right hemispheres are specialized for approach and avoidance motivation,
      respectively. With the Sword and Shield Hypothesis (SSH) we challenge this
      conclusion; we propose that the lateralization of motivation depends on the
      lateralization of motor control for the dominant and non-dominant hands (used
      preferentially for approach and avoidance actions, respectively). The SSH
      predicts that the laterality of approach motivation should vary continuously with
      the laterality of circuits supporting approach-related actions. We measured mood
      before and after 5 sessions of tDCS applied bilaterally to DLPFC in right- and
      left-handers. Results in right-handers show that positive emotions increased
      after left-excitatory stimulation, but decreased after right-excitatory
      stimulation.&#160; In non-right-handers, however, the opposite pattern was found:
      Positive emotions decreased after left-excitatory stimulation, but increased
      after right-excitatory stimulation. These results reveal continuous covariation
      between the neural systems for action and emotion, supporting the SSH.</p>
