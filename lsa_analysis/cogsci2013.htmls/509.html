	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>When studying, the reliability of metacognitive monitoring, the
      predicted achievements at test, is strongly associated with the quality of study
      regulation and with ultimate performance at test. Previous studies that compared
      learning texts on screen to learning from printed texts found that screen
      learners performed worse and were overconfident about their success. The present
      research examined two methods for overcoming screen inferiority in these
      respects. Gaining experience with the study-test task with six different texts
      allowed improvement. Writing keywords after a delay from learning already
      eliminated screen inferiority from the first studied texts. In both methods,
      predictions of performance did not reflect changes in test scores. The two
      methods clearly affected screen and paper learners differently. This study
      outlines directions for overcoming screen inferiority, but also calls attention
      to the effects of context on cognitive and metacognitive processes, beyond the
      mere interaction between the person and the task content.</p>
