	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We present original evidence that abstract and concrete concepts
      are organized and represented differently, based on statistical analyses of
      thousands of concepts in publicly available datasets. First, we show that
      abstract and concrete concepts have differing patterns of association with other
      concepts. Second, we test recent hypotheses that abstract concepts are organized
      according to association, whereas concrete concepts are organized according to
      (semantic) similarity. Third, we present evidence suggesting that concrete
      representations are more strongly feature-based than abstract representations. We
      argue that degree of feature- based structure may fundamentally determine
      concreteness, and discuss implications for cognitive and computational models of
      meaning.
