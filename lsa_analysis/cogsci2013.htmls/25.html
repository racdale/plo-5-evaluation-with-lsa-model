	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Since the cognitive revolution, a widely held assumption has
      been that&#8212;whereas content may vary across cultures&#8212;cognitive
      processes would be universal, especially those on the
      more basic levels. Even if scholars do not fully subscribe to
      this assumption, they often conceptualize, or tend to investigate,
      cognition as if it were universal (Henrich, Heine, &
      Norenzayan, 2010). The insight that universality must not be
      presupposed but scrutinized is now gaining ground, and cognitive
      diversity has become one of the hot (and controversial)
      topics in the field (Norenzayan & Heine, 2005). We argue
      that, for scrutinizing the cultural dimension of cognition,
      taking an anthropological perspective is invaluable, not only
      for the task itself, but for attenuating the home-field disadvantages
      that are inescapably linked to cross-cultural research
      (Medin, Bennis, & Chandler, 2010).</p>
