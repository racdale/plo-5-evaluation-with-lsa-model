	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>How individuals think about opposing or paradoxical categories
      influences their social relationships. We found that Chinese managers were more
      likely than US managers to categorize attempts to outperform others as an
      instance of both competition and cooperation. Further, the Chinese managers were
      more likely than the US managers to perceive a given working relationship as
      being both cooperative and competitive. The two findings were linked:
      culturally-guided beliefs about whether the cooperation-competition paradox
      should be integrated or kept separate influenced how individuals understood their
      social relationships. More broadly, the implication is that category membership
      and relations between categories are guided by cultural influences distinct from
      the particulars of the categories themselves that normally enter into cognitive
      science research on categories. In addition, those categorization choices are
      consequential for the network of social relationships individuals form.</p>
