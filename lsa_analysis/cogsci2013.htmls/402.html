	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>One of the challenges in developing multi-agent systems is the
      creation of agents able to exhibit human-like behaviours in complex social
      situations. In order to do so, agents need to be socially aware of their
      environment and perceive other agents not only as individuals but also as social
      group members. Following Social Identity and Self-Categorization theories, we
      developed the Dynamic Identity Model for Agents that provides agents with the
      ability to adapt their identity and behaviour to the social context. We then
      implemented it in a social dilemma scenario where different situations were
      explored.</p>
