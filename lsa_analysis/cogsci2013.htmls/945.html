	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In extracting statistical regularities from the seemingly random
      environment, our minds grow special interests in patterns. To account for such a
      behavior, much research has been focusing on top-down influences such as the
      representativeness heuristic and Bayesian belief updating. Here we take a
      reverse-engineering approach by first examining the waiting time statistics and
      the self-overlap property of patterns and revealing a normative basis for
      people's special attention to patterns. With a unsupervised neural network
      simulation, we show that different patterns may leave different traces in mind
      corresponding to the waiting time statistics, indicating an early pattern
      dissociation without any top-down guidance. We argue that the sense of randomness
      could have started locally with short sequences and emerged early at the
      perceptual level, and, the process of spatial-temporal association may be the
      early driving force towards a structured hypothesis space.</p>
