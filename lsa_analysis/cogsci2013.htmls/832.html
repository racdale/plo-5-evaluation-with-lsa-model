	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Automatic parallel processing occurs in visual search when a
      target differs from other display objects on a salient visual dimension and the
      phenomenon is termed &#8216;popout&#8217;. The present two studies answers the
      question: Do the interference effects cancel or add? Both studies used a ring of
      twelve fixed-size green circles with embedded Gabors oriented vertically or
      horizontally. Targets and foils were one of green square, a larger green circle,
      or a red circle. Each of these served as a target for one of the three sessions,
      with the others serving as foils. In one task the observer found the target and
      reported its Gabor orientation. The other task used targets only on one half the
      trials and the observer reported target presence or absence. In both tasks
      accuracy was uniformly high. In both tasks RT interference increased from one to
      two foils, the slowing mainly isolated to the slowest decile of RTs.</p>
