	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>People judge that harmful side effects are intentional, e.g., a
      CEO who introduces a new program to increase profits that results in harm to the
      environment is judged to have intentionally harmed the environment. They judge
      helpful side effects are unintentional, e.g., a CEO who introduces a new program
      to increase profits that results in helping the environment is not judged to have
      intentionally helped the environment. We report two experiments that suggest the
      effect arises because people believe individuals can make alternative choices in
      bad situations and not in good ones. </p>
