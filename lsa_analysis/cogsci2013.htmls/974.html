	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Previous research on word & category learning has hypothesized
      that memory processes may be critical to the long-term ability to generalize
      information. The current experiment was designed to elucidate the recognition
      memory processes occurring during children and adults&#8217; category learning.
      Participants were presented with a novel noun generalization task and five
      recognition memory tasks. The results revealed that there were developmental
      differences in (a) the retention for information presented during category
      exemplar presentations, and, (b) the sub-categories of recognition memory that
      were significantly related to category learning performance. These findings
      suggest the relationship between recognition memory and category learning
      processes may change across development.</p>
