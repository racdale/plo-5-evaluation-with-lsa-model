	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>One significant challenge in creating accurate models of human
      decision behavior is accounting for the effect of context. Research shows that
      seemingly minor changes in the presentation of a decision can lead to drastic
      shifts in behavior; phenomena collectively referred to as framing effects.
      Previous work has developed Context Dependent Utility (CDU), a framework
      integrating Appraisal Theory with decision-theoretic principles. This work
      extends existing research by presenting a study exploring the behavioral
      predictions offered by CDU regarding the multidimensional effect of context on
      decision behavior.

      The present study finds support for the predictions of CDU regarding the impact
      of context on decisions: 1) as perceptions of pleasantness increase, decision
      behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 2) as perceptions of goal-congruence
      increase, decision behavior tends towards risk-aversion; 3) as perceptions of
      controllability increase, i.e., perceptions that outcomes would have been
      primarily caused by the decision maker, behavior tends towards risk-seeking.
