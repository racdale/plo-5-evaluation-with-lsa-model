	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Political scientists are increasingly turning to game-theoretic
      models to understand and predict the behavior of national leaders in wartime
      scenarios, where two sides have the options of seeking resolution at either the
      bargaining table or on the battlefield. While the theoretical analyses of these
      models is suggestive of their ability to capture these scenarios, it is not clear
      to what degree human behavior conforms to such equilibrium-based expectations. We
      present the results of a study that placed people within two of these game
      models, playing against an intelligent agent. We consider several testable
      hypotheses drawn from the theoretical analyses and evaluate the degree to which
      the observed human decision-making conforms to those hypotheses. </p>
