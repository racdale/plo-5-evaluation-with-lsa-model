	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Novices often lack metacognition and self-regulation skills that
      are important for effective learning. Betty's Brain, an open-ended computer-based
      learning environment helps students practice and develop metacognitive strategies
      as they learn science topics. We extend previous work on sequence mining methods
      to discover students' frequently-used behavior patterns from their activity
      sequences. Our results show that it is possible to interpret aspects of students'
      learning strategies and their effectiveness by taking into ac-count the context
      of their activities in the system.</p>
