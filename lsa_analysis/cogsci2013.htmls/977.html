	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Humans use counterfactual thinking in order to evaluate their
      previous choices, comparing the actual outcome of a choice with what would have
      happened if they had chosen another action option. Two prototypical emotions
      resulting from such counterfactual evaluations are guilt and regret, both of
      which play an important role in regulating human choice behavior. Guilt is
      thought to refer specifically to social choices, while regret occurs for both
      individual and social choices. Here, we introduce an fMRI compatible new
      experimental paradigm to differentially induce guilt and regret under controlled
      conditions as a result of real decision. Behavioral data confirm that guilt but
      not regret specifically occurs in a social context (i.e. after harm for another
      person caused by own choices). On the neural level, initial results point to a
      critical involvement of different sub-regions within the prefrontal cortex in the
      processing of guilt vs. regret.</p>
