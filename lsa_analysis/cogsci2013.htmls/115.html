	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Prior research on the development of category-based reasoning
      indicates a protracted developmental course of this ability as well as a high
      degree of individual variability. However, the sources of this individual
      variability as well as the sources of developmental change remain unclear. The
      present study aimed to examine these issues, with a focus on the role of
      representational change and executive function development. Across two time
      points spaced approximately 7 months apart, children&#8217;s category-based
      reasoning was assessed along with a battery of executive function and
      representational change measures. Results replicated prior work in that only a
      small proportion of children exhibited spontaneous category-based reasoning at
      Time 1, and this proportion increased with development. In addition, both
      executive function and representational change were found to predict the
      development of category-based reasoning. </p>
