	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Production choices are driven by many factors: experience with
      language statistics, task-or message-specific factors and constraints on human
      cognition. Understanding how these constraints operate together is crucial for
      understanding sentence production. 
      Speakers described human and inanimate targets (baby/vase) in scenes showing
      human agents acting on these targets. The task elicited relative clauses to
      contrast targets from competitors (&#8220;The baby/vase that the woman is
      carrying/that is being carried by the woman&#8221;). Participant utterances were
      affected by target noun animacy, and this effect persists across languages. This
      suggests a role for learning; a speaker&#8217;s lifetime of experience with their
      language, including structure alternatives afforded by each language, affects
      production choices. 
      In addition to long-term learning, immediate demands affect production choices.
      Targets varied in visual salience, which affected structure choices. Effects are
      consistent with a task-dependent account of visual salience. 
      Immediate and long-term learning motivations for these effects will be
      discussed.</p>
