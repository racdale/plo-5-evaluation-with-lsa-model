	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Berlyne, the Canadian psychologist, famously conjectured that the
      aesthetic preference for visual patterns is an inverted-U function of their
      complexity. In my own research (Chipman, 1977), I developed and studied a large
      set of patterns, exploring what determined their judged complexity. These
      included patterns with several types of well defined structure, as well as
      randomly generated patterns. Several experiments explored the judged aesthetic
      quality of such patterns. Judged aesthetic quality was not any simple function of
      judged complexity. Not surprisingly, there are significant individual differences
      in aesthetic preference, including differences in preference for different types
      of visual structure.</p>
