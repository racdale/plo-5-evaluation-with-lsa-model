	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It is now generally accepted that words&#8217; emotional content
      plays a role in lexical processing, but the literature offers incompatible
      findings concerning what this role may be. Here we use a large sample of lexical
      decision data (British Lexicon Project, Keuleers et al., 2012) and we carry out a
      series of analyses differing in the way emotional variables are treated. A
      variety of statistical approaches yielded common conclusions: when confounding
      variables are taken into account, emotional words, whether positive or negative,
      are processed faster than neutral words. This effect is categorical rather than
      graded; is not modulated by emotional arousal; and is not limited to words
      explicitly referring to emotions. We discuss this in terms of internally
      grounding words&#8217; meanings in emotional experience, akin to the manner in
      which concepts may be grounded in perception and action.</p>
