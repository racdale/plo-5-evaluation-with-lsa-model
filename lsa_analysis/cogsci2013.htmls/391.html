	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Infants and children are avid learners. This constant aggregation
      of new knowledge, however, can interfere with past and future learning. Proactive
      interference (PI) occurs when past learning interferes with new learning, while
      retroactive interference (RI) is the attenuation of memory for previous learning
      as a result of new knowledge. Previous work has demonstrated that adults and
      children display PI and RI effects, but the developmental trajectories of these
      effects are less clear. The current study developed a new associative learning
      paradigm to concurrently test PI and RI in preschoolers and adults. Results
      demonstrated the presence of RI, and these effects were stable across age groups,
      suggesting that the mechanisms that modulate RI effects may already be mature in
      these age groups. No PI effects were found in either group, however. This
      surprising result suggests the role of associative complexity as a possible
      modulator of PI in these age groups. </p>
