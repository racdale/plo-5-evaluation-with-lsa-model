	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The relationship between structural (or syntactic) processing in
      music and in language is not yet clear. Evidence indicating that these two
      processes are shared conflicts with other results suggesting that they are
      largely distinct. These conflicting findings suggest that musical and linguistic
      processing may share some, but not all, underlying processes, raising the
      question of what exactly those shared processes might be. Two experiments tested
      the idea that one shared process is cognitive control by pairing manipulations of
      musical structure with the Stroop task, a standard test of cognitive control.
      Manipulations of harmonic expectancy, but not of timbral expectancy, interacted
      with Stroop interference effects, suggesting that cognitive control is at least
      one specific process underlying shared syntactic processing in music and
      language.</p>
