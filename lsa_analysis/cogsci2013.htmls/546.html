	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Performing inductive generalizations is critical for learning, yet
      there is much debate regarding the mechanisms underlying this ability. One view
      posits that similarity-based induction, utilizing perceptual features, may allow
      for increased encoding and higher memory accuracy on recognition tests. While
      category-based induction, utilizing semantic information, may result in limiting
      encoding of perceptual detail, thus resulting in decreased memory accuracy. In
      Experiment 1, we attempted to impair spontaneous categorization by presenting a
      second Working Memory load task. In Experiment 2, we attempted to impair
      perceptual processing by introducing a second Visual Search task. Results
      indicate that adult participants can rely on either mechanism when performing
      induction.  </p>
