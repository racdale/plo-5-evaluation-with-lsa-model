	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We develop and implement a new approach to utilizing color
      information for object and scene recognition that is inspired
      by the characteristics of color- and object-selective neurons in
      the high-level inferotemporal cortex of the primate visual system.
      In our hierarchical model, we introduce a new dictionary
      of features representing visual information as quantized color
      blobs that preserve coarse, relative spatial information. We run
      this model on several datasets such as Caltech101, Outdoor
      Scenes and Underwater Images. The combination of our color
      features with (grayscale) shape features leads to significant increases
      in performance over shape or color features alone. Using
      our model, performance is significantly higher than using
      color naively, i.e. concatenating the channels of various color
      spaces. This indicates that usage of color information per se is
      not enough to produce good performance, and that it is specifically
      our biologically-inspired approach to color that results in
      significant improvement.</p>
