	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The processing of social information belongs to the most
      complex cognitive capacities of humans, enabling us to live
      together in social communities. The symposium will focus
      on the everyday competence to form social impressions and
      understand others. This capability includes 1. the
      understanding of oneself on the basis of an explicit selfconstrual,
      2. the understanding of others by processing their
      mental and bodily characteristics and states 3. the
      understanding of social encounters by adequately
      interpreting actions, communicative signals and social roles.
      Human communication is essentially embedded in cultural
      contexts and is shaped by it; at the same time it constitutes
      the cultural background shared by the interactants. The main
      goal of this symposium is to investigate the role of cognitive
      and cultural factors influencing self-construal, person
      perception and understanding of others. Thus we deal with
      the following leading questions: How do we understand
      other human beings, what are the best theoretical
      perspectives, what can we learn from cognitive psychology
      and neurosciences and what is the role of culture in the
      process of understanding oneself and others? In the recent
      development of social cognition it has become clear that we
      not only have to account for the observational stance
      towards other people but that we also have to systematically
      consider situations of online interaction with other human
      beings (2nd person perspective). The main aim of the
      symposium is to present the state of the art of some key
      topics of social and cultural cognition from the perspectives
      of philosophy of mind, cross-cultural psychology and
      social-cognitive neuroscience as well as to outline some
      paradigmatic lines for future research.</p>
