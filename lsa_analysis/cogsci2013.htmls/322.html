	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We report an experiment investigating how concurrent verbalisation
      during a task can affect performance (a so-called "reactivity" effect).
      Participants studied three-variable line graphs while (a) concurrently thinking
      aloud or (b) silently studied the graphs and provided an interpretation once they
      felt they had understood it. Results showed that verbalisation hindered
      performance significantly compared to the silent condition. To support the claim
      that the act of verbalising was hindering performance, competing explanations
      were also tested, which confirmed thinking aloud as the most likely cause. This
      contradicts claims by Ericsson and Simon (1993) that thinking aloud reflects but
      does not affect performance and provides further evidence that verbalising
      thought processes can hinder performance.
