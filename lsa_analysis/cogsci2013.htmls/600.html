	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In a world of limited resources, scarcity and rivalry are central
      challenges for decision makers. We examine choice behavior in competitive
      probability learning environments that reinforce one of two strategies. The
      optimality of a strategy is dependent on the behavior of a computerized opponent:
      if the opponent mimics participant choices, probability matching is optimal; if
      the opponent is indifferent, probability maximizing is optimal. We observed
      accurate asymptotic strategy use in both conditions suggesting participants were
      sensitive to the differences in opponent behavior. Moreover, the results
      emphasize that &#8216;irrational&#8217; probability matching can be adaptive once
      such competitive pressures are taken into account. The application of
      reinforcement learning models to the data suggests that computational
      conceptualizations of opponent behavior are critical to account for the observed
      divergence in strategy adoption.</p>
