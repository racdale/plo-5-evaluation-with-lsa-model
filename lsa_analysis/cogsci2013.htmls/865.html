	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Coordinating actions with another person can be a challenging
      endeavor for young children. For smooth coordination of actions with another
      person two skills are hypothesized to be crucial: action prediction and
      inhibitory control. In this study, we investigated how developing abilities of
      action prediction and inhibitory control are related to young children&#8217;s
      joint action coordination. Using a simple turn-taking game,
      2&#189;-year-olds&#8217; joint action coordination performance (timing
      variability and accuracy) was assessed. Additionally, children&#8217;s action
      prediction skills were measured by anticipatory looks using eye-tracking.
      Inhibitory control was tested in an age-appropriate gift delay task. Results show
      that timing stability during the joint coordination was positively correlated to
      measures of action prediction. In turn, accuracy in the joint coordination was
      positively correlated with measures of inhibitory control. These findings
      indicate a distinctive role of action prediction and inhibitory action control
      for different coordination qualities (timing variability and accuracy) in young
      children.</p>
