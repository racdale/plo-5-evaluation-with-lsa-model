	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Models of cognitive processes often include simplifications,
      idealisations, and fictionalisations, so how should we learn about cognitive
      processes from such models? Particularly in cognitive science, when many features
      of the target system are unknown, it is not always clear which simplifications,
      idealisations, and so on, are appropriate for a research question, and which are
      highly misleading. Here we use a case-study from studies of language evolution,
      and ideas from philosophy of science, to illustrate a robustness approach to
      learning from models. Robust properties are those that arise across a range of
      models, simulations and experiments, and can be used to identify key causal
      structures in the models, and the phenomenon, under investigation. For example,
      in studies of language evolution, the emergence of compositional structure is a
      robust property across models, simulations and experiments of cultural
      transmission, but only under pressures for learnability and expressivity. This
      arguably illustrates the principles underlying real cases of language evolution.
      We provide an outline of the robustness approach, including its limitations, and
      suggest that this methodology can be productively used throughout cognitive
      science. Perhaps of most importance, it suggests that different modelling
      frameworks should be used as tools to identify the abstract properties of a
      system, rather than being definitive expressions of theories.</p>
