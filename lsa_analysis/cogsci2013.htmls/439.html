	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Solving an open problem as proposed by inventing and productive
      failure approaches has been shown to prepare learners effectively for subsequent
      direct instruction even though invented solutions are often suboptimal for the
      given problems. Inventing can make the learners aware of knowledge gaps
      (cognitive) and more curious about and interested in the learning contents
      (motivational effects). However, working on the same problem with a given
      (optimal) solution helps avoid misconceptions and disorganized knowledge, while
      providing useful basic knowledge. Therefore, a given solution could be more
      effective. In an experiment (N = 42), we tested to what extent working on an open
      problem (inventing) versus a solution prepares student teachers for learning
      strategy evaluation. The inventing group invented criteria to evaluate learning
      strategies while the worked solution group studied the same problem in a solved,
      worked-out version. We found differential effects: inventing enhanced
      knowledge-gap experience, curiosity, and interest. However, studying the
      worked-out solution enhanced learning outcomes.</p>
