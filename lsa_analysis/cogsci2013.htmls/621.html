	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>A novel computational cognitive model explains human procedural
      error in terms of declarative memory processes. This is an early version of a
      process model intended to predict and explain multiple classes of procedural
      error a priori. We begin with postcompletion error (PCE),  a type of systematic
      procedural error that people are prone to commit when there is one step to
      perform after they have accomplished their main task goal. Participants in an
      experiment demonstrated increased PCE rates following an interruption in a
      realistic form-filling task. The model explains PCE as a consequence of two
      declarative retrieval processes, spreading activation and base-level activation,
      competing with each other because of features of task and working memory
      structure. Our intention is to generalize the model to other classes of
      procedural error in complex task environments.</p>
