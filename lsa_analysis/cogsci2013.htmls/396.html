	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract> In their evaluation of the integration cost component of
      Dependency
        Locality Theory on the Dundee Corpus, Demberg and Keller (2008)
        found no significant main effect of DLT integration cost on reading
        times, but suggested that this might be due to auxiliaries incurring
        some of the full verb's integration cost and thus facilitating
        processing of the verb. This hypothesis however, has to date not
        been tested. The present paper fills this gap by reporting an
        experiment on subject vs.~object relative clauses including
        auxiliaries, as well as by testing Demberg and Keller's hypothesis
        directly on the Dundee Corpus.

        A further contribution of this paper is methodological: we replicate
        experimental results on the subject vs.~object relative clause
        assymmetry in a self-paced-reading experiment run remotely on the
        web using WebExp.
      </p>
