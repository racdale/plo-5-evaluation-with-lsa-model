	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We report a study of naming and lexical decision with 132 adult
      Greek speakers responding to 150 words and matched pseudowords with decorrelated
      frequency, length, neighborhood, syllable and bigram frequency, and transparency.
      This approach allowed us to individuate and accurately estimate the effects of
      each variable, and to assess their linearity and additivity. Significant effects
      of frequency, length, and syllable frequency were revealed, as well as several
      interactions. The results are informative for cognitive modeling of visual word
      recognition in more transparent orthographies.</p>
