	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The art concept plays an essential part in the creation of
      contemporary art. In order to capture the progress of the formation process of an
      art concept, we conducted a case study of a contemporary artist. We interviewed a
      professional artist about his creation process once every three weeks for about
      ten months. This report focuses on an early phase of the search for ideas, in
      which he took many photographs to collect visual information to form the core
      part of the art concept. Using both the photographs he took and the interview
      data collected during this phase, we identify when and how features of his art
      concept emerged. The results show that his art concept was formed through cycles
      of two types of search for visual information: an active, explorative search to
      find the unexpected, and more a focused search to interpret it.</p>
