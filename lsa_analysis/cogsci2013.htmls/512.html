	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>'Thinking outside the box' is a nice metaphor, but we are so used
      to putting things in boxes that it may seem essential to our way of thinking.
      This idea is enforced by the standard view of relations that says that relata
      always come in a certain order. There is, however, an alternative view on
      relations, the antipositionalist view, according to which the constituents of the
      complexes of a relation neither come in a certain order, nor do they occupy
      positions. Instead, a relation is conceived as a network of interrelated
      complexes. We show that this view facilitates a coordinate-free way of thinking
      and that it may thus have a heuristic value.</p>
