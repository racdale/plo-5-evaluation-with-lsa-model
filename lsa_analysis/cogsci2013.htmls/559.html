	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Jones and Rachlin (2008) found that the amount of money a person
      is willing to forgo in order to give $75 to another person decreased as a
      hyperbolic function of perceived social distance, in the same way as occurs in
      intertemporal choice. This study aimed to extend this finding to the domain of
      social networks, in which social distance is defined by degrees of separation. A
      total of 334 participants responded to tasks very similar to those in Jones and
      Rachlin (2008), except that they were required to choose whether they would
      prefer to receive an amount of money for themselves only or an amount of money
      for themselves and a person who is n degrees of separation from them up to six
      degrees. The results show that the hyperbolic function fit the data well, and
      that several processes appear to contribute to the judgments made in the
      experimental tasks.</p>
