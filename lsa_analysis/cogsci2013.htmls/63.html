	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>It is generally assumed that the character position targeted
      within a
      particular word is not under direct cognitive control, but is rather
      determined by oculomotor processes sensitive only to word length and
      distance. An alternative view is that readers target more distant
      characters in words when they have parafoveally processed these words
      more. These possibilities are difficult to distinguish because the
      actual landing site within a word has large effects on subsequent word
      processing measures. In two experiments, we decoupled the targeted
      location from the actual landing site by shifting the text 3
      characters during the saccade into a target word. Results show that
      subsequent word processing time given a particular landing site was
      lower/higher when the eyes would have landed further forward/backward
      in the word. This effect remains significant in some cases when
      controlling for saccade launch site. These data provide evidence against
      the oculomotor theory and support a cognitive account of saccade
      targeting.</p>
