	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of semantic
      congruence and spatial orientation on verification time of modus ponens (MP) and
      modus tollens (MT) conclusions. Factorial experiment (2x2x2) with repeated
      measures was carried out. Conditionals expressed the vertical relation of two
      objects in congruent (If cellar is down, then attic is up) or incongruent manner
      (If attic is down, then cellar is up). Eight pairs of words with clear vertical
      relation were used. Order of vertical relations in the conditional was also
      manipulated. Conditionals were in the form of &#8220;If P down, then Q up&#8221;,
      or &#8220;If P up, then Q down&#8221;. Participants (N=48) had to verify the
      presented conclusions in 64 tasks as quickly as possible. Significant effects for
      valid MP conclusions were obtained. Conclusions containing &#8220;down-up&#8221;
      order of relations in conditional premise were processed faster. Congruent
      spatial relations also facilitated faster answers.</p>
