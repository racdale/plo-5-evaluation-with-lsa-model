	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>As an agent gathers information about its environment and monitors
      the decisions of other agents, its behavior may fluctuate adaptively over short
      time scales while still maintaining a long-term strategy. We designed a real-time
      virtual environment to experimentally investigate the relationship between the
      micro-level dynamics of dyadic behavior within single games and the macro-level
      dynamics of outcomes across iterated games.

      In one experiment, participants played a real-time game of "chicken,"
      simultaneously guiding avatars toward high-payoff or low-payoff targets. If both
      participants reached a demarcated vicinity of a target at the same time, that
      target was destroyed. We recorded their trajectories, and induced uncertainty by
      adding noise to their movement speeds. At the macro-level, we found evidence of
      self-organized turn-taking across repeated games. At the micro-level, we found
      that even within a turn-taking equilibrium, both players competitively pursued
      the high payoff for a period of time before one of them diverted.</p>
