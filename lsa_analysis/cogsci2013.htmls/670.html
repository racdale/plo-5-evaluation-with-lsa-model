	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Research on the mental representation of numbers has focused on a
      horizontally aligned mental number line, but more and more findings have begun to
      implicate a vertical orientation as well. We investigate the relationship between
      these two orientations when people generate random numbers. In the horizontal
      condition, people generated larger numbers when they looked right as opposed to
      left. In the vertical condition, people generated larger numbers when they looked
      up as opposed to down. We present two main results based on analyses that compare
      the two spatial orientations. First, we show that the vertical effect was
      stronger than the horizontal one. Second, we show a weak correlation between the
      vertical and the horizontal effect, potentially suggesting a shared underlying
      mechanism.</p>
