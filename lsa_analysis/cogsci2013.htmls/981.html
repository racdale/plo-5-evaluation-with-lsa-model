	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Three humans interacted with a spiking neural network model that
      controls the lip and jaw muscles of a speech synthesizer. The model learns using
      spike-timing dependent plasticity that is greater when reinforcement is received.
      First the humans each selectively reinforced the model, encouraging it to more
      frequently produce vocalizations with speech-like syllabic elements. Afterwards,
      for each human-reinforced simulation a yoked control simulation was generated.
      All the sounds produced during the course of learning for all human-reinforced
      and all yoked control simulations were then judged on a four-point syllable
      quality scale by all three listeners (sounds were presented in random order). In
      all cases, these judgments indicated that the human-reinforced models produced
      more sophisticated babbling over the course of learning whereas the yoked control
      simulations did not. The results support this model of how canonical babbling, a
      major developmental milestone, may develop.</p>
