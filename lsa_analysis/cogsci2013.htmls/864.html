	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The Maxim of Quantity states that a speaker should provide enough
      information for an object to be identified but no more (Grice, 1975). However,
      research has shown that children tend to produce too little information
      (under-description) and adults tend to provide too much information
      (over-description). In this study, we examined the production of referring
      expressions across the course of development (i.e. 7&#8211;18 years).
      Participants were required to generate a referring expression, and we manipulated
      the presence or absence of a contrasting object and display complexity. Results
      showed an age effect on the production of under-descriptions: Young children
      produced significantly more under-descriptions in more complex arrays compared to
      older children. In addition, an analysis of voice onset times and eye movements
      investigated whether there are speed-accuracy tradeoffs associated with visual
      search and the tendency to include extra information. Conclusions focus on the
      development of reference mechanisms from childhood to adulthood.   </p>
