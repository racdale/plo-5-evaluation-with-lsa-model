	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>We explore the interaction between information sampling and the
      structure of the social environment in the case of two prominent social learning
      strategies: imitate-the-best and imitate-the-majority. In a series of simulations
      a group of agents made repeated choices between options. We varied the building
      blocks of the strategies used by agents, the structure of the social network and
      characteristics of the task environment. A key factor influencing
      strategies&#8217; success is the speed with which they are able to respond to
      environmental change. In general, imitate-the-best provides a faster response
      compared to imitate-the-majority and larger samples help the former but hurt the
      latter. Less efficient networks decrease the performance of both, but are more
      detrimental for imitate-the-majority. Our findings highlight the role of sampling
      and social structure in the study of social learning, an area not sufficiently
      explored before.</p>
