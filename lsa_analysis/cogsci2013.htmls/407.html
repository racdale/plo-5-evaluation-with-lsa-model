	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In contrast to symbolic models of language understanding, embodied
      models of language comprehension suggest that language is closely connected with
      visual and motor processing. In the current study we show that motion words, such
      as rise or fall, are processed faster if displayed against a background of
      compatible motion (e.g., upward vs. downward random dot motion with 60% motion
      coherence). However,
      this interaction between semantic processing and visual processing only occurred
      if the word and the motion display were presented simultaneously. If the visual
      motion display was short-lived and occurred 100 or 200 ms after word-onset, no
      interactions between language and visual motion were
      found. We suggest that only in situations that do not allow ignoring or
      strategically suppressing the visual motion display, supra-threshold visual
      motion can affect language
      comprehension.</p>
