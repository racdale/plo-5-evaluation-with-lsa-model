	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>To learn the meaning of a new word, children must solve two
      distinct problems: identify the referent under ambiguity and determine how to
      generalize that word&#8217;s meaning to new objects. Traditionally, these two
      problems have been addressed separately in the literature, despite their tight
      relationship with one another. We present a hierarchical Bayesian model that
      jointly infers both the referent of a word in ambiguous con- texts and the
      concept associated with a word. As a first step in testing this model, we provide
      evidence that our model fits human data in a simple cross-situational concept
      learning task.</p>
