	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>The study aimed to study the inhibitory mechanism in syllogistic
      reasoning when the outputs of the heuristic strategy and analytic reasoning
      disagree. We manipulated the congruency of the quantifier of the conclusion with
      those of the two premises according to the matching strategy and the validity of
      the syllogism. After each syllogistic evaluation task, a lexical decision task
      was used to check if the semantic content of the conclusions was inhibited. The
      results suggested that after correctly solved conflict problems (match-invalid or
      mismatch-valid), the semantic priming effect of the words related to the two
      terms in the conclusion diminished. For no-conflict problems, the recognition
      time of the related words was faster than that of the unrelated words. The
      results suggested that inhibition on the content of a syllogism may not only be
      triggered by the conflict induced by the believability but also by the surface
      structure of the syllogisms.</p>
