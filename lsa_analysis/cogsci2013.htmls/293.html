	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Several computational models explaining fixation durations in
      scene viewing (Nuthmann, Smith, Engbert, & Henderson, 2010) and in reading
      (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, &
      Rayner, 1998) assume that saccade programming is completed in two stages: an
      initial, labile stage that is subject to cancellation and an subsequent,
      non-labile stage in which the program can no longer be cancelled. This
      distinction is motivated by findings from double-step experiments that used much
      simpler situations than scene viewing or reading. Here, we adopt a classic
      double-step paradigm to a scene-viewing context. In a Static condition targets
      are presented to the left or right of a central fixation cross along a horizontal
      axis while in a Scene condition targets are presented in a gaze contingent manner
      along a trajectory defined by the location of recent fixations. We found evidence
      in support of the claims that saccade cancellation occurs within a naturalistic
      scene-viewing context and that saccade cancellation can account for increases in
      observed fixation duration distributions. The duration of the non-labile stage
      was estimated to be longer in the Scene condition compared to the Static
      condition. </p>
