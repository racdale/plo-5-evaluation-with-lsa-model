	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Logical consistency and objectivity are cornerstones of science
      that distinguish it from cult and dogma.  Scientists&#8217; concern with
      objectivity has led to the dominance of associative statistics, which define the
      basic concept of independence on observations.  The same concern with avoiding
      subjective beliefs has led many scientific journals to favor frequentist over
      Bayesian statistics.  Our analysis here reveals that to infer causes of a binary
      outcome, (1) the associative definition of independence results in a logical
      inconsistency -- even for data from an ideal experiment -- for both frequentist
      and Bayesian statistics, and (2) removing the logical error requires defining
      independence on counterfactual causal events. The logically coherent causal
      definition is the one intuitively adopted by humans. Our findings have direct
      implications for more consistent and generalizable causal discoveries in medicine
      and other sciences.</p>
