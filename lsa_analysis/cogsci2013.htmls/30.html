	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Remembering frequently involves collaboration among two or more
      individuals, often taking the form of a conversation.  In some conversations, one
      person conveys new information to another, as when a daughter announces to her
      mother that she is engaged.  In other conversations, two people talk to each
      other about a shared past, as when a couple reminisce about the evening on which
      they became engaged.   The later instance has the potential to shape both what
      emerges in the discussion, as when one participant scaffolds the remembering of
      the other.  It also has the potential to reshape how participants might
      subsequently remember the material, with the possibility that the memories of the
      participants will become more similar.  In other words, what people remember is,
      in part, the result of how they jointly recount the past with others.  Yet,
      despite the critical contribution of joint conversational remembering to memory,
      detailed study of this phenomenon is only beginning to be undertaken.  The
      objective of this symposium is to bring together several strands of research that
      explores conversational, or, more generally, communicative influences on memory. 
      The speakers offer a range of different approaches.  Dr. Stone explores how
      public speeches can induce forgetting as well as reinforce memories across a
      large population and thereby promote a mnemonic convergence through a single
      social interaction.  Dr. Echterhoff considers the role of motivation in
      moderating conversational influences.  Dr. Coman investigates whether these
      conversational influences propagate across large networks of individuals and can
      thereby promote a mnemonic convergence.  Dr. Edelson examines the neuroscience
      underlying memory conformity.  And Dr. Michaelian engages the philosophical
      underpinning of the concept of collective memory.  In a short summation, Dr.
      Hirst places these papers in the larger context of social aspects of memory and
      moderates further discussion.
