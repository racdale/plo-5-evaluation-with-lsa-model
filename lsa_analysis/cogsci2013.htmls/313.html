	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>In the 1970s and 80s Cognitive Science and Cognitive Linguistics
      and Computational Psycholinguistics emerged as the boxes around our disciplines
      started to become straight-jackets, and research out of one discipline would
      start to make waves in others. The toy systems of Artificial Intelligence were
      reaching limits, and introspection by programmers and engineers was reinventing
      square wheels without any biological plausibility and in ignorance of relevant
      work across the cognitive sciences, while conversely, work in other fields often
      lacked the understanding of computability and complexity necessary to ensure that
      models were realistic and computationally plausible.

      This is the starting point for the research program I have been undertaking for
      the last 35 years, seeking to build intelligent computer systems and
      computational cognitive models. The idea has been to try to build an intelligent
      system modelled on the way a baby learns about the world, culture, society and
      language. Conversely, the idea has been to explore theories from psychology,
      linguistics and neuroscience through the medium of computational models.</p>
