	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>This study examined how the students' expectation of context
      sharing with audience causes effects on their writing arguments. Fourth-grade
      students (N=30) from elementary school in Japan were assigned to do two writing
      argument tasks. In each task, students made an argument and persuaded different
      audiences (transfer student and old friend) at random. The contents of written
      arguments were categorized into "claims", "evidence", and "reasoning". Moreover,
      difficulty of each audience's persuasion and its reasons were asked in
      questionnaire. The analysis suggested followings. (1) Students generated more
      "reasoning" in transfer student condition than old friend. (2) Students evaluated
      persuasion of transfer student was more difficult than old friend. Students
      judged that the transfer students do not share much context with them, so they
      tried to persuade by giving more information. The students read the degree of
      context sharing and changed the contents of writing with changing audiences.</p>
