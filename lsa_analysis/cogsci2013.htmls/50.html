	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Although people expect to improve by investing effort in solving a
      problem, several studies have found negative time-confidence correlations in
      problem-solving tasks. The present study employed the metacognitive approach to
      illuminate why, despite lengthy thinking, people provide solutions with low
      confidence. According to the proposed Diminishing Criterion Model (DCM), as
      people invest longer, their confidence in their solution increases in a
      goal-driven manner, in accordance with the common belief. Nevertheless, the
      process ends up with a negative time-confidence correlation, because people find
      lower confidence levels as satisfactory as they invest longer in a problem,
      reflecting a compromise in their stopping criterion. The hypotheses derived from
      the DCM were supported with two problem types. When a &#8220;don&#8217;t
      know&#8221; response was allowed, the participants still provided low confidence
      solutions after lengthy thinking, suggesting that they found these low confidence
      solutions to be satisfactory. The study offers reconciliation between beliefs and
      empirical findings.</p>
