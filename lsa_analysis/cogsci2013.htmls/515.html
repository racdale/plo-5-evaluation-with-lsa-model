	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Some evidence in very recent psychological studies have
      demonstrated that motor simulation ability is crucial for the correct
      understanding of social intentions. The present study was conducted first to
      confirm that the nature of the motor intention leads to early modulations of
      movement kinematics. Then, we tested whether humans could read an agent&#8217;s
      intention when observing the very first element of a complex action sequence.
      Results revealed early variations in movement kinematics and further showed that
      human agents can use these deviants to distinguish above chance level between
      three different social actions. Similar performance levels were found using an
      artificial classifier (Neural Network) and this procedure demonstrated
      furthermore that decisions could be taken on the basis of information contained
      in the first 500ms of movement kinematics. Taken together these results confirm
      the importance of motor simulation for adapted social interaction, and suggest
      how robotic adaptive controllers may use as input low-level motor information
      (e.g. kinematics) to afford biologically inspired social behaviors.</p>
