	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Metacognition plays a fundamental role in forming self-judgments
      of ability and knowledge.  Is metacognition domain and gender specific? 
      Metacognitive judgments and performance were measured across biology, literature,
      and math content.  Undergraduates took three shortened SAT II Subject Tests, and
      provided estimates of their performance both before and after taking each test. 
      The results were that judgments differed across domain and gender. 
      Overconfidence was evident in all domains, although estimates of ability were
      more accurate after taking a test.  Males tended to be more overconfident, while
      females were less confident yet more accurately calibrated when estimating
      ability.  Students were over-confident in math, bringing into question the
      existence of math phobia.  Improvement in calibration and gender difference in
      calibration were most noticeable in math.</p>
