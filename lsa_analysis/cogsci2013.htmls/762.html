	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Children must distinguish between statements and questions in
      order to accurately acquire language, but it is unclear when or how they do it. 
      Experiment 1 examined whether prosodic characteristics of infant-directed
      questions and statements could differentiate them. Statements and yes/no
      questions differed on several dimensions, but statements and wh-questions did
      not.  Experiment 2 tested whether 11-13-month-olds could nevertheless distinguish
      sentence types using lexical information. Half the infants were familiarized to
      statements, the remainder to questions. All infants were tested on new sentences
      of both types.  Sentences were resynthesized to have monotone pitch and matched
      utterance-final vowel length, neutralizing any prosodic differences.   Overall,
      there was a significant novelty preference and no interaction of trial type with
      familiarization type. Thus, while prosody is insufficient for distinguishing
      wh-questions from statements, by 11-months infants can use word order to
      distinguish statements and questions. This ability could provide an important
      foundation for acquiring syntactic knowledge.
