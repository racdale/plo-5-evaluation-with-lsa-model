	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>As a ubiquitous trend in the cognitive development of children,
      the &#8216;relational shift&#8217; accounts for a change in preference for
      absolute percepts towards a preference for relational percepts, and is observed
      across a wide variety of domains. Extensive evidence indicates that this
      prepotency for relational processing is also observed in how children process
      melodies. When recalling melodies, younger children typically recall more
      absolute pitch properties than older children, while the exact opposite occurs in
      older children. Using DORA (Discovery Of Relations by Analogy; Doumas et al.,
      2008), a domain-general symbolic-connectionist model of relation learning, we
      simulated the relational shift in melodic perception of children age 3-6 years
      based on an experiment by Sergeant and Roche (1973). DORA&#8217;s performance
      matched the children&#8217;s well, suggesting common developmental and perceptual
      mechanisms between the relational shift in melodic processing and the shift seen
      across other domains.</p>
