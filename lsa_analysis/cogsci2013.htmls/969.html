	<h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p id=abstract>Moyamoya disease is a rare entity characterized by progressive
      narrowing of intracranial blood vessels. Moyamoya in most cases does not respond
      well to medical therapy and often leads to surgical revascularization. The
      physiological benefits of the surgery for Moyamoya patients have been well
      documented, yet the effects of surgery on cognitive skills are far less studied.
      Participants in the current study were 30 patients, 24 to 85 years of age, who
      underwent surgery and were all treated at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.
      All patients underwent a physical and cognitive preoperative evaluation, where
      speech, memory, and intellectual processes were measured. After the surgical
      intervention, patients returned for 3 follow-up assessments over a period of 6
      months. All patients experienced stabilization or improvement of physiological
      symptoms. Regarding cognitive functions, speech, memory, and intellectual
      processes improved significantly after surgery. Further prospective studies are
      needed to better assess cognitive outcomes after revascularization for
      Moyamoya.</p>
